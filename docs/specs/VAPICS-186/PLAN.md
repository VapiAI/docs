## Introduction

This document defines **how** Vapi documentation should be written. The goal: users self-serve, discover more features, and never need to open a support ticket.

Three principles govern everything:

1. **Progressive structure** — concepts build sequentially, no page assumes knowledge that hasn't been introduced earlier
2. **Plain language** — plain English by default, jargon explained inline, zero assumed knowledge
3. **Anti-verbosity** — every sentence earns its place, docs respect the reader's time

The full document includes the progressive learning tree with dependency graph, language style guide with banned words list, anti-verbosity playbook with scanability checklist, a reusable doc page template, and an AI agent brief for automated drafting/review.

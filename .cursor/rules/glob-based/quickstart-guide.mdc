# Quickstart Guide Standards

## Objectives

Get users to "Hello World" moment fast with minimal steps required.

## Structure Requirements

### Prerequisites Section
Always include:
- Account requirements (e.g., "A Vapi account")
- API key access instructions
- Any required downloads or installations

### Implementation Paths
Provide multiple implementation options using `<Tabs>` or `<CodeBlocks>`:
- Dashboard (no-code approach)
- TypeScript/JavaScript SDK
- Python SDK
- cURL (for API examples)

### Step-by-Step Format
Use `<Steps>` component for all tutorials:

```mdx
<Steps>
  <Step title="Clear action title">
    Brief explanation of what this step accomplishes.
    
    [Implementation details with code examples]
  </Step>
  <Step title="Next action">
    Continue with logical progression...
  </Step>
</Steps>
```

## Content Guidelines

### Code Examples
- Always provide working, copy-pastable code
- Include all necessary imports and setup
- Replace placeholder values clearly (e.g., `YOUR_API_KEY`)
- Test all code examples before publishing

### Visual Elements
- Include screenshots or videos for Dashboard workflows
- Use `<Frame>` components for important visual guidance
- Keep videos short and focused (< 30 seconds)

### Language & Tone
- Start with "In this quickstart, you'll learn to:"
- Use active voice and present tense
- Keep explanations conciseâ€”save deep dives for other docs
- End with clear "Next steps" pointing to relevant guides

### Success Validation
Each quickstart should include:
- Clear success criteria ("You should see...")
- Troubleshooting for common issues
- Testing instructions to verify implementation

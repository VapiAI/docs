# Workflow Documentation Standards

Workflows use visual decision trees and conditional logic for complex multi-step processes.

## Workflow Purpose

Perfect for:
- Appointment scheduling with availability checks
- Lead qualification with branching questions  
- Complex customer service flows with escalation
- Multi-step data collection and validation

## Documentation Structure

### Core Sections Required
1. **Overview** - Workflow purpose and business context
2. **Flow diagram** - Visual representation of the decision tree
3. **Configuration** - Step-by-step setup instructions
4. **Variables and data** - Input/output data structures
5. **Testing scenarios** - Comprehensive test cases
6. **Integration points** - External systems and APIs

## Content Guidelines

### Flow Visualization
- Include visual flow diagrams showing decision paths
- Use clear node labels and condition descriptions
- Highlight error handling and edge case paths
- Show data flow between steps

### Business Context
- Explain the real-world problem being solved
- Provide specific use case scenarios
- Include success metrics and KPIs
- Reference industry best practices

### Technical Implementation
- Detail all configuration steps
- Include variable definitions and schemas
- Provide API integration examples
- Cover error handling strategies

## Workflow Components

### Decision Nodes
Document:
- Condition logic and evaluation criteria
- Branch paths and outcomes
- Fallback behaviors
- Variable dependencies

### Data Collection
Document:
- Input validation rules
- Required vs optional fields
- Data transformation logic
- Storage and retrieval patterns

### Integrations
Document:
- External API endpoints
- Authentication requirements
- Rate limiting considerations
- Error response handling

## Templates

### Workflow Overview
```mdx
## Overview

Build [workflow type] with [key capabilities]. This workflow handles [business scenario] using [decision logic approach].

**Business Use Case:**
[Describe the real-world problem this solves]

**Workflow Capabilities:**
- [Primary capability with decision logic]
- [Secondary capability with data handling]
- [Integration capability with external systems]

**Flow Overview:**
[High-level description of the workflow path]
```

### Testing Template
```mdx
## Test the Workflow

### Test Scenarios

| Scenario | Input | Expected Path | Expected Outcome |
|----------|-------|---------------|------------------|
| [Happy path] | [Sample input] | [Main flow] | [Success result] |
| [Edge case 1] | [Edge input] | [Alternative path] | [Handled result] |
| [Error case] | [Invalid input] | [Error handling] | [Error resolution] |

### Validation Steps
1. Test each decision branch independently
2. Verify data persistence across steps
3. Confirm integration endpoints respond correctly
4. Validate error handling and recovery
```

title: Production readiness checklist
subtitle: Validate your voice AI assistant is ready for production deployment
slug: observability/production-readiness
---

## What is production readiness?

**Production readiness** means your voice assistant has been systematically validated across instrumentation, testing, extraction, and monitoring **before** you deploy it to handle real customer calls.

Deploying without production readiness means:
- ❌ Finding bugs with real customers (embarrassing, expensive)
- ❌ No visibility into operational health (flying blind)
- ❌ Can't measure success or improvement (no data-driven optimization)
- ❌ Production debugging is reactive, not proactive

**This checklist helps you avoid those problems** by ensuring you've instrumented, tested, and validated before launch.

## How to use this checklist

### Progressive validation

You don't need to complete ALL stages before deploying. The checklist is **progressive**:

1. **INSTRUMENT + TEST = Minimum viable production** — You must instrument and test before deploying
2. **EXTRACT + MONITOR = Production-grade** — Add monitoring once you're handling real traffic
3. **OPTIMIZE = Mature observability** — Continuous improvement based on data

**For your first deployment**: Complete INSTRUMENT + TEST checklist items. Add EXTRACT + MONITOR within 1-2 weeks of production launch.

### Checklist format

Each stage has:
- ✅ **Required** items (must complete before considering this stage "done")
- 🟡 **Recommended** items (nice-to-have, increases confidence)
- 📊 **Validation** (how to verify the item is complete)

### Required items

<Steps>
  <Step title="Define Structured Outputs for key metrics">
    - [ ] Call success/failure indicated (boolean or enum field)
    - [ ] Customer information captured (name, contact info, or relevant identifiers)
    - [ ] Business outcome tracked (booking created, question answered, escalation needed)

    **Validation**: Run a test call, verify structured output populates in Dashboard
  </Step>

  <Step title="Choose appropriate field types">
    - [ ] Scalar fields (string, number, boolean) for data you want queryable in Boards
    - [ ] Object fields for rich data you'll extract via webhooks (if using Webhook or Hybrid pattern)
    - [ ] Schema matches your chosen extraction pattern (see [Extraction patterns](/observability/extraction-patterns))

  </Step>

  <Step title="Test instrumentation with sample calls">
    - [ ] Make 3-5 test calls covering common scenarios
    - [ ] Verify structured outputs populate correctly
    - [ ] Confirm data appears in Dashboard (if using Dashboard Native or Hybrid pattern)

    **Validation**: Check Dashboard > Calls tab, verify structured output values are correct
  </Step>
</Steps>

### Recommended items

- 🟡 Define Structured Outputs for edge cases (unclear requests, escalations, errors)
- 🟡 Add sentiment analysis or CSAT scoring (if applicable)
- 🟡 Capture metadata useful for debugging (tool calls, LLM reasoning, timestamps)

<span className="internal-note"> Are there other common instrumentation patterns we should recommend?</span>

  <Step title="Create regression tests for critical paths">
    - [ ] Test core conversation flows end-to-end
    - [ ] Test tool calls execute correctly (if assistant uses tools)
    - [ ] Test edge cases discovered during development

    **Validation**: Regression suite runs cleanly (all tests pass)
  </Step>

  <Step title="Validate assistant behavior matches requirements">
    - [ ] Assistant responds appropriately to expected user inputs
    - [ ] Tone and voice match brand guidelines
    - [ ] Error handling works (unclear input, unexpected requests)

### Required items

<Steps>
  <Step title="Confirm extraction pattern is implemented">
    - [ ] **Dashboard Native**: Scalar Structured Outputs flowing to Boards ✅
    - [ ] **Webhook-to-External**: Webhook endpoint receiving call data ✅
    - [ ] **Hybrid**: Both Boards and webhooks working ✅

    **Validation**: See pattern-specific validation below
  </Step>

  <Step title="Validate data is flowing correctly">
    **If Dashboard Native**:

    **If Hybrid**:
    - [ ] Operational metrics (scalars) appear in Boards
    - [ ] Rich analytics (objects) received via webhooks

    **Validation**: Make test call, trace data from call → Boards/webhooks → storage
  </Step>

  <Step title="Scorecard configuration (if using quality scoring)">
    - [ ] Scorecard rules defined and tested
    - [ ] Webhook configured to receive Scorecard results (required — not available in Boards)
    - [ ] Scorecard results validated against expected thresholds

    **Validation**: Run test calls with known outcomes, verify Scorecard scores are correct
  </Step>
</Steps>

### Recommended items

- 🟡 Document extraction architecture for your team

## Stage 4: MONITOR ✓

### Required items

<Steps>
  <Step title="Create operational dashboard (Boards or external BI)">
    - [ ] Track call volume (calls per day/week)
    - [ ] Track call success rate (% of calls achieving primary goal)
    - [ ] Track cost ($/day or $/call)
    - [ ] Track error rate (% of calls with failures/escalations)

    **Validation**: Dashboard updates with real data after test calls
  </Step>

  <Step title="Define baseline metrics (what's 'normal'?)">
    - [ ] Document expected call volume range
    - [ ] Document expected success rate threshold (e.g., &gt;85% success)
    - [ ] Document expected cost per call (for budget tracking)

    **Validation**: Run production for 1-2 weeks, establish baseline from real data
  </Step>

  <Step title="Set up monitoring cadence">
    - [ ] Assign team member(s) to check dashboards daily

## Production readiness gates

Use these **gates** to decide if you're ready to progress:

### Gate 1: Ready for FIRST production deployment?

**Must complete**:
- ✅ INSTRUMENT Stage (all required items)
- ✅ TEST Stage (all required items)

**Can deploy**: Yes — you have basic instrumentation and testing

**Next step**: Launch with limited traffic, add EXTRACT + MONITOR within 1-2 weeks

---

### Gate 2: Ready for SCALED production deployment?

**Must complete**:
- ✅ INSTRUMENT Stage
- ✅ TEST Stage
- ✅ EXTRACT Stage (all required items)
- ✅ MONITOR Stage (all required items)

**Can scale**: Yes — you have visibility and can detect problems

**Next step**: Increase traffic, begin OPTIMIZE Stage (continuous improvement)

---

### Gate 3: Production-grade observability maturity?

**Must complete**:
- ✅ All stages (INSTRUMENT → TEST → EXTRACT → MONITOR → OPTIMIZE)
- ✅ At least one optimization iteration completed
- ✅ Team trained on monitoring and improvement workflow

**Maturity level**: Production-grade — observability is systematic, not ad-hoc

**Next step**: Refine and iterate (observability is continuous)

---

## Common readiness mistakes

### Mistake 1: Deploying without instrumentation

**Symptom**: "We deployed but can't tell if it's working"

**Impact**: No data to debug issues, optimize, or measure success

**Fix**: Go back to INSTRUMENT stage, add Structured Outputs, redeploy

---

### Mistake 2: No regression testing

**Symptom**: "Every change breaks something we fixed before"

**Impact**: Quality degrades over time, user trust erodes

**Fix**: Build regression test suite (Evals), run before every deployment

---

### Mistake 3: Over-engineering extraction before launch

**Symptom**: "We're 3 weeks into building webhook infrastructure, haven't launched yet"

**Impact**: Delayed launch, opportunity cost

**Fix**: Start with Dashboard Native pattern (simple), add webhooks after validating product-market fit

---

### Mistake 4: Monitoring exists but nobody checks it

**Symptom**: "We have dashboards but didn't notice success rate dropped 20% last week"

**Impact**: Problems detected late (via customer complaints, not monitoring)

**Fix**: Assign monitoring owner, set check cadence, define alert thresholds

---

### Mistake 5: No optimization workflow

**Symptom**: "We have data but don't know how to improve"

**Impact**: Assistant quality stagnates, competitors improve faster

**Fix**: Define optimization workflow (weekly review → hypothesis → test → deploy), run first iteration

---

## Deployment workflow with readiness gates

Recommended workflow for production deployment:

```
Week 1-2: Build assistant + INSTRUMENT + TEST
  ↓
Week 2: Gate 1 — Ready for first deployment?
  ↓
Week 3: Deploy to limited production traffic (10-20 calls/day)
  ↓
Week 3-4: Add EXTRACT + MONITOR (while limited traffic runs)
  ↓
Week 4: Gate 2 — Ready for scaled deployment?
  ↓
Week 5+: Scale traffic (100+ calls/day), begin OPTIMIZE
  ↓
Ongoing: Continuous optimization loop
```

**Key principle**: Don't over-engineer early. Launch with minimum readiness (Gate 1), add monitoring as you scale.

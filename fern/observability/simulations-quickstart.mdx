## Overview

This quickstart guide will help you test your AI assistants and squads using realistic, AI-powered callers. In just a few minutes, you'll create test scenarios, define success criteria, and validate your agents work correctly under different conditions.

### What are Simulations?

Simulations is Vapi's voice agent testing framework that enables you to systematically test assistants and squads using AI-powered callers that follow defined goals and evaluate outcomes. Instead of relying on manual testing or rigid scripts, Simulations recreate real conversations and measure whether your assistant behaves correctly. Test your agents by:

1. **Creating personalities** - Define how the AI caller behaves (e.g., decisive, indecisive, impatient)
2. **Defining scenarios** - Specify the caller's goal, constraints, and success criteria
3. **Running simulations** - Pair scenarios with personalities to test your assistant
4. **Monitoring results** - Watch tests in real time and review pass/fail outcomes
5. **Tracking performance** - Analyze historical results to identify trends

### When are Simulations useful?

Simulations help you maintain quality and catch issues early:

- **Pre-deployment testing** - Validate new assistant configurations before going live
- **Regression testing** - Ensure prompt or tool changes don't break existing behaviors
- **Conversation flow validation** - Test multi-turn interactions and complex scenarios
- **Personality-based testing** - Verify your agent handles different caller types appropriately
- **Squad handoff testing** - Ensure smooth transitions between squad members
- **Performance monitoring** - Track success rates over time and identify regressions

### What you'll build

A simulation suite for an appointment booking assistant that tests:

- Different caller personalities (decisive vs. indecisive)
- Goal completion and success criteria validation
- Real-time monitoring of test calls
- Historical performance tracking

<Warning>
  Running a suite will execute actual voice calls to your assistant. Ensure your assistant is properly configured before running tests.
</Warning>

## Step 6: Review results

Analyze the results of your simulation runs to understand how your assistant performed.

### Successful run

When all simulations pass, you'll see:

```json
{
  "id": "run-123",
  "suiteId": "suite-xyz",
  "status": "completed",
  "results": [
    {
      "simulationId": "simulation-abc",
      "status": "pass",
      "successCriteria": [
        {
          "criterion": "Appointment is confirmed with a specific date and time",
          "passed": true
        },
        {
          "criterion": "Confirmation number is provided",
          "passed": true
        }
      ],
      "duration": "45s"
    }
  ],
  "summary": {
    "total": 3,
    "passed": 3,
    "failed": 0
  }
}
```

**Pass criteria:**

- `status` is "completed"
- `results[].status` is "pass" for all simulations
- All `successCriteria` items show `passed: true`

### Failed run

When validation fails, you'll see details about what went wrong:

```json
{
  "id": "run-124",
  "suiteId": "suite-xyz",
  "status": "completed",
  "results": [
    {
      "simulationId": "simulation-abc",
      "status": "fail",
      "successCriteria": [
        {
          "criterion": "Appointment is confirmed with a specific date and time",
          "passed": true
        },
        {
          "criterion": "Confirmation number is provided",
          "passed": false,
          "reason": "No confirmation number was mentioned in the conversation"
        }
      ],
      "duration": "52s"
    }
  ],
  "summary": {
    "total": 3,
    "passed": 2,
    "failed": 1
  }
}
```

**Failure indicators:**

- `results[].status` is "fail"
- `successCriteria[].passed` is `false` with a `reason` explaining the failure

</Tabs>

<Note>
  Full conversation recordings are available for all simulation runs, making it easy to understand exactly what happened during each test.
</Note>

## Troubleshooting

| Issue | Solution |
| --- | --- |
| Simulation always fails | Check that success criteria are achievable with your assistant's current capabilities |
| Run stuck in "running" | Verify your assistant is properly configured and responding to calls |
| Personality not applied | Ensure the personality ID is correctly linked to the simulation |
| Success criteria unclear | Make criteria specific and measurable (e.g., "mentions confirmation number" vs "completes task") |
| No audio in recording | Check that your assistant has voice configuration enabled |
| Suite won't start | Verify all simulations in the suite are valid and have targets assigned |

### Common errors

**"assistant-error" status:**

- Check your assistant configuration (model, voice, tools)
- Verify API keys are valid
- Test the assistant manually before running simulations

**Success criteria failures:**

- Review the conversation recording to understand what happened
- Adjust criteria to be more specific or more flexible as needed
- Consider whether the personality is making the test unrealistically difficult

<Warning>
  If simulations consistently fail, test your assistant manually first to ensure it's working correctly before debugging the simulation configuration.

## Tips for success

<Tip>
  **Best practices for effective simulation testing:**

  - **Start simple** - Begin with straightforward scenarios before testing edge cases
  - **Use realistic personalities** - Model your test callers after actual customer types
  - **Define clear success criteria** - Specific, measurable criteria lead to reliable tests
  - **Group related tests** - Organize suites by feature or user flow
  - **Monitor trends** - Track pass rates over time to catch regressions early
  - **Test after changes** - Run your simulation suites after updating prompts or tools
  - **Listen to recordings** - Audio recordings reveal issues that metrics alone miss
  - **Iterate on failures** - Use failed tests to improve both your assistant and test design

## Overview

Voice agents involve multiple AI systems working together—speech recognition, language models, and voice synthesis. When something goes wrong, systematic debugging helps you quickly identify and fix the root cause.

**Most common issues fall into these categories:**

<CardGroup cols={2}>
  <Card title="Speech & Understanding" icon="microphone">
    * Agent doesn't understand user input correctly
    * Responses are inappropriate or inconsistent
    * Agent sounds robotic or unnatural
  </Card>
  <Card title="Technical & Integration" icon="gear">
    * Call quality issues or audio problems
    * Tool integrations failing or returning errors
    * Workflow logic not executing as expected
  </Card>

## Dashboard debugging resources

The [Vapi dashboard](https://dashboard.vapi.ai/) provides powerful debugging features to help you identify and fix issues quickly:

### Call Logs

Navigate to `Observe > Call Logs` to:
- Review complete call transcripts
- Check call duration and completion status
- Identify where calls failed or ended unexpectedly
- See tool execution results and errors
- Analyze conversation flow in workflows

<video autoPlay loop muted src="./static/videos/debugging/call-logs.mp4" type="video/mp4" style={{ aspectRatio: '16 / 9', width: '100%' }} />

### API Logs

Navigate to `Observe > API Logs` to:
- Monitor all API requests and responses
- Check for authentication errors
- Verify request payloads and response codes
- Debug integration issues with external services

<video autoPlay loop muted src="./static/videos/debugging/api-logs.mp4" type="video/mp4" style={{ aspectRatio: '16 / 9', width: '100%' }} />

### Webhook Logs

Navigate to `Observe > Webhook Logs` to:
- Verify webhook deliveries to your server
- Check server response codes and timing
- Debug webhook authentication issues
- Monitor event delivery failures

<video autoPlay loop muted src="./static/videos/debugging/webhook-logs.mp4" type="video/mp4" style={{ aspectRatio: '16 / 9', width: '100%' }} />

Use the Vapi CLI to forward webhooks to your local development server:

```bash
# Terminal 1: Create tunnel (e.g., with ngrok)
ngrok http 4242

# Terminal 2: Forward webhooks
vapi listen --forward-to localhost:3000/webhook
```

<Note>
`vapi listen` is a local forwarder that requires a separate tunneling service. Update your webhook URLs in Vapi to use the tunnel's public URL. [Learn more →](/cli/webhook)
</Note>

### Voice Test Suites

Navigate to `Test > Voice Test Suites` to:
- Run automated tests on your assistants (not available for workflows)
- Test conversation flows with predefined scenarios
- Verify assistant behavior across different inputs
- Monitor performance over time

<video autoPlay loop muted src="./static/videos/debugging/voice-test-suites.mp4" type="video/mp4" style={{ aspectRatio: '16 / 9', width: '100%' }} />

### Tool Testing

For any tool in your `Tools` section:
- Navigate to `Tools > [Select Tool]`
- Use the `Test` button to send sample payloads
- Verify tool responses and error handling
- Debug parameter extraction and API calls

## Speech and language issues

| Problem | Symptoms | Solution |
|---------|----------|----------|
| **Transcription accuracy** | Incorrect words in transcripts, missing words/phrases, poor performance with accents | Switch to more accurate transcriber. |
| **Intent recognition** | Agent responds to wrong intent, fails to extract variables, workflow routing to wrong nodes | Make system prompt / node prompt more specific; use clear enum values; adjust the temperature to ensure consistent outputs |
| **Response quality** | Different responses to identical inputs, agent forgets context, doesn't follow instructions | Review system prompt / node prompt specificity; check model configuration; adjust temperature to achieve consistency |

**Debug steps for response quality:**
1. **Review system prompt** - Navigate to your assistant/workflow in the [dashboard](https://dashboard.vapi.ai/) and check the system prompt specificity
2. **Check model configuration** - Scroll down to `Model` section and verify:
   - You're using an appropriate model (e.g., `gpt-4o`)
   - `Max Tokens` is sufficient for response length
   - Necessary tools are enabled and configured correctly

| Response Issue | Solution |
|----------------|----------|
| **Responses too long** | Add "Keep responses under X words" to system prompt |
| **Robotic speech** | Switch to a different voice provider |
| **Forgetting context** | Use models with larger context windows |
| **Wrong information** | Check tool outputs and knowledge base accuracy via `Call Logs` |

## Tool and workflow debugging

| Problem Type | Issue | Solution |
|--------------|-------|----------|
| **Tool execution** | Tools failing, HTTP errors, parameter issues | Navigate to `Observe > Call Logs` and check tool execution section, test tools individually at `Tools > [Select Tool] > Test`, validate configuration |
| **Variable extraction** | Variables not extracted, wrong values, missing data | Be specific in variable descriptions, use distinct enum values, add validation prompts |
| **Workflow logic** | Wrong node routing, conditions not triggering, variables not passing | Use `Call Logs` to trace conversation path, verify edge conditions are clear, check global node conflicts |

**Variable extraction details:**

| Problem | Cause | Solution |
|---------|-------|----------|
| **Variables not extracted** | Unclear description | Be specific in variable descriptions: "Customer's 10-digit phone number" |
| **Wrong variable values** | Ambiguous enum options | Use distinct enum values: "schedule", "cancel", "reschedule" |
| **Missing required variables** | User didn't provide info | Add validation prompts to request missing data |

## Common error patterns

| Error Pattern | Likely Cause | Quick Fix |
|---------------|--------------|-----------|
| **Agent misinterpreting speech** | Speech recognition issue | Check transcriber model, add custom keyterms |
| **Irrelevant responses** | Poor prompt engineering | Be more specific in system prompt |
| **Call drops immediately** | Configuration error | Check all required fields in assistant/workflow settings |
| **Tool errors** | API integration issue | Test tools individually, verify endpoint URLs |
| **Long silences** | Model processing delay | Use faster models or reduce response length |

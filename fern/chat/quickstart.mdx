slug: chat/quickstart
---

## Overview

Build a customer service chat bot that can handle text-based conversations through your application. Perfect for adding AI chat to websites, mobile apps, or messaging platforms.

**What You'll Build:**
* A working chat integration that responds to user messages
* Context-aware conversations that remember previous messages
* Both one-shot and multi-turn conversation patterns

**Agent Capabilities:**
* Instant text responses without voice processing
* Maintains conversation context across multiple messages
* Compatible with existing OpenAI workflows

## Prerequisites

* A [Vapi account](https://dashboard.vapi.ai/)
* An existing assistant or willingness to create one
* Basic knowledge of making API requests

## Scenario

We'll create a customer support chat for "TechFlow", a software company that wants to handle common questions via text chat before escalating to human agents.

---

## 1. Get Your API Credentials

<Steps>
  <Step title="Open the Vapi Dashboard">
    Go to [dashboard.vapi.ai](https://dashboard.vapi.ai) and log in to your account.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Navigate to API Keys">
    Click on your profile in the top right, then select `Vapi API Keys`.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Copy your API key">
    Copy your Private API Key. You'll need this for all chat requests.
    
    <Warning>
    Keep this key secure - never expose it in client-side code.
    </Warning>
  </Step>
</Steps>

---

## 2. Create or Select an Assistant

<Steps>
  <Step title="Navigate to Assistants">
    In your Vapi dashboard, click `Assistants` in the left sidebar.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Create a new assistant (or use existing)">
    - Click `Create Assistant` if you need a new one
    - Select `Blank Template` as your starting point
    - Name it `TechFlow Support`
    - Set the first message to: `Hello! I'm here to help with TechFlow questions. What can I assist you with today?`
  </Step>
  <Step title="Configure the system prompt">
    Update the system prompt to:

    ```txt title="System Prompt" maxLines=8
    You are a helpful customer support agent for TechFlow, a software company. 
    
    Your role:
    - Answer common questions about our products
    - Help troubleshoot basic issues  
    - Escalate complex problems to human agents
    
    Keep responses concise and helpful. Always maintain a friendly, professional tone.
    ```
  </Step>
  <Step title="Copy the Assistant ID">
    After publishing, copy the Assistant ID from the URL or assistant details. You'll need this for API calls.
  </Step>
</Steps>

## 3. Send Your First Chat Message

<Steps>
  <Step title="Test with curl">
    Replace `YOUR_API_KEY` and `your-assistant-id` with your actual values:
    
    ```bash title="First Chat Request"
    curl -X POST https://api.vapi.ai/chat \
      -H "Authorization: Bearer YOUR_API_KEY" \
      -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
      -d '{
        "assistantId": "your-assistant-id",
        "input": "Hi, I need help with my TechFlow account"
      }'
    ```
  </Step>
  <Step title="Verify the response">
    You should receive a JSON response like:
    
    ```json title="Chat Response"
    {
      "id": "chat_abc123",
      "assistantId": "your-assistant-id",
      "messages": [
        {
          "role": "user",
          "content": "Hi, I need help with my TechFlow account"
        }
      ],
      "output": [
        {
          "role": "assistant",
          "content": "I'd be happy to help with your TechFlow account! What specific issue are you experiencing?"
        }
      ],
      "createdAt": "2024-01-15T09:30:00Z",
      "updatedAt": "2024-01-15T09:30:00Z"
    }
    ```
  </Step>
</Steps>

## 4. Build a Multi-Turn Conversation

<Steps>
  <Step title="Continue the conversation">
    Use the `previousChatId` from the first response to maintain context:
    
    ```bash title="Follow-up Message"
    curl -X POST https://api.vapi.ai/chat \
      -H "Authorization: Bearer YOUR_API_KEY" \
      -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
      -d '{
        "assistantId": "your-assistant-id",
        "previousChatId": "chat_abc123",
        "input": "I forgot my password and can't log in"
      }'
    ```
  </Step>
  <Step title="Test context awareness">
    Send another message to verify the assistant remembers the conversation:
    
    ```bash title="Context Test"
    curl -X POST https://api.vapi.ai/chat \
      -H "Authorization: Bearer YOUR_API_KEY" \
      -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
      -d '{
        "assistantId": "your-assistant-id", 
        "previousChatId": "chat_abc123",
        "input": "What was my original question?"
      }'
    ```
  </Step>
</Steps>

## 5. Integrate with TypeScript

<Steps>
  <Step title="Create a simple chat function">
    Here's a TypeScript function you can use in your application:
    
    ```typescript title="chat.ts"
    interface ChatMessage {
      role: 'user' | 'assistant';
      content: string;
    }

    interface ChatApiResponse {
      id: string;
      assistantId: string;
      messages: ChatMessage[];
      output: ChatMessage[];
      createdAt: string;
      updatedAt: string;
      orgId?: string;
      sessionId?: string;
      name?: string;
    }

    interface ChatResponse {
      chatId: string;
      response: string;
      fullData: ChatApiResponse;
    }

    async function sendChatMessage(
      message: string, 
      previousChatId?: string
    ): Promise<ChatResponse> {
      const response = await fetch('https://api.vapi.ai/chat', {
        method: 'POST',
        headers: {
          'Authorization': 'Bearer YOUR_API_KEY',
          'Content-Type': 'application/json'
        },
        body: JSON.stringify({
          assistantId: 'your-assistant-id',
          input: message,
          ...(previousChatId && { previousChatId })
        })
      });

      if (!response.ok) {
        throw new Error(`HTTP error! status: ${response.status}`);
      }

      const chat: ChatApiResponse = await response.json();
      return {
        chatId: chat.id,
        response: chat.output[0].content,
        fullData: chat
      };
    }
    
    // Usage example
    const firstMessage = await sendChatMessage("Hello, I need help");
    console.log(firstMessage.response);
    
    const followUp = await sendChatMessage("Tell me more", firstMessage.chatId);
    console.log(followUp.response);
    ```
  </Step>
  <Step title="Test your integration">
    Run your TypeScript code to verify the chat integration works correctly.
  </Step>
</Steps>

## 6. Test Your Chat Bot

<Steps>
  <Step title="Test various scenarios">
    Try these test cases to ensure your chat bot works correctly:
    
    ```bash title="Test Case 1: General Question"
    curl -X POST https://api.vapi.ai/chat \
      -H "Authorization: Bearer YOUR_API_KEY" \
      -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
      -d '{
        "assistantId": "your-assistant-id",
        "input": "What are your business hours?"
      }'
    ```
    
    ```bash title="Test Case 2: Technical Issue"
    curl -X POST https://api.vapi.ai/chat \
      -H "Authorization: Bearer YOUR_API_KEY" \
      -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
      -d '{
        "assistantId": "your-assistant-id",
        "input": "My app keeps crashing when I try to export data"
      }'
    ```
  </Step>
  <Step title="Verify conversation memory">
    Send follow-up messages using `previousChatId` to ensure context is maintained.
  </Step>
</Steps>

## Next Steps

Take your chat bot to the next level:

* **[Streaming responses](/chat/streaming)** - Add real-time typing indicators and progressive responses
* **[Non-streaming responses](/chat/non-streaming)** - Learn about sessions and complex conversation flows
* **[OpenAI compatibility](/chat/openai-compatibility)** - Integrate with existing OpenAI workflows

If you're building a production application on Vapi, we can help you every step of the way from idea to full-scale deployment.

On the Pay-As-You-Go plan, there is a limit of **10 concurrent calls**. On Enterprise, we reserve GPUs for you on our Enterprise cluster so you can scale up to **millions of calls**.

#### Enterprise Plans include:

- Reserved concurrency and higher rate limits
- Hands-on 24/7 support
- Shared Slack channel with our team
- Included minutes with volume pricing
- Calls with our engineering team 2-3 times per week

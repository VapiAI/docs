## Overview

<Warning>
Free Vapi phone numbers are only available for US national use. International numbers are not free, and you can only create up to 10 free numbers per account.
</Warning>

You can create and configure phone numbers with Vapi to place and receive calls. Vapi provides free phone numbers for national (US) use onlyâ€”international numbers are not free. For international or custom use, you can import your own numbers from Twilio.

## Setting up a phone number

You can set up a phone number to place and receive calls in two ways:

- **Create a free US phone number:**
  - Use the Vapi dashboard or the [`/phone-numbers`](/api-reference/phone-numbers/create) endpoint.
  - Free numbers are only available for US national use.

- **Import your own number (for international or custom use):**
  - Use the dashboard or the [`/phone-numbers/import`](/api-reference/phone-numbers/import-twilio-number) endpoint.
  - This uses your Twilio credentials to verify and configure the number with Vapi services.

## Outbound calls

You can place an outbound call from one of your phone numbers using the [`/call`](/api-reference/calls/create-phone-call) endpoint.
- If the system message will be different with every call, specify a temporary assistant in the `assistant` field.
- To reuse an assistant, specify its ID in the `assistantId` field.
- [Read more about outbound calls](/phone-calling/outbound-calls)

## Inbound calls

You can provide an `assistantId` to a phone number, and it will use that assistant for inbound calls.
- To specify the assistant based on the caller's phone number, leave the `assistantId` blank. Vapi will attempt to retrieve the assistant from your server using your [Server URL](/server-url#retrieving-assistants).

<Accordion title="Set up a Phone Number">
You can set up a phone number to place and receive phone calls. Phone numbers can be created directly through Vapi, or you can use your own from Twilio.

You can create a free phone number through the dashboard or use the [`/phone-numbers`](/api-reference/phone-numbers/create) endpoint.

If you want to use your own phone number, you can also use the dashboard or the [`/phone-numbers/import`](/api-reference/phone-numbers/import-twilio-number) endpoint. This will use your Twilio credentials to verify the number and configure it with Vapi services.

</Accordion>

<Accordion title="Outbound Calls">
  You can place an outbound call from one of your phone numbers using the
  [`/call/phone`](/api-reference/calls/create-phone-call) endpoint. If the system message will be
  different with every call, you can specify a temporary assistant in the `assistant` field. If you
  want to reuse an assistant, you can specify its ID in the `assistantId` field.
</Accordion>

<Accordion title="Inbound Calls">
You can provide an `assistantId` to a phone number and it will use that assistant when receiving inbound calls.

You may want to specify the assistant based on the caller's phone number. If a phone number doesn't have an `assistantId`, Vapi will attempt to retrieve the assistant from your server using your [Server URL](/server-url#retrieving-assistants).

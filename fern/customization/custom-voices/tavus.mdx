This guide outlines the procedure for integrating your custom replica with Tavus through the VAPI platform.

<Note>An API subscription is required for this process to work. This process is only required if you would like to use your **custom Tavus replicas**. This process is not required to use stock replicas on the Vapi platform.</Note>

To integrate your custom replica with [Tavus](https://platform.tavus.io/) using the VAPI platform, follow these steps.

1. **Obtain a Tavus API Subscription:** Visit the [Tavus pricing page](https://platform.tavus.io/billing) and subscribe to an API plan.
2. **Retrieve Your API Key:** Go to the [API Keys section](https://platform.tavus.io/api-keys) on Tavus to get your API key.
3. **Enter Your API Key in VAPI:** Navigate to the [VAPI Provider Key section](https://dashboard.vapi.ai/keys) and input your Tavus API key under the Tavus section.
4. **Enter Your Custom Replica ID:** After adding your API key, you can select Tavus as your assistant's voice provider and add your Custom Replica ID manually through the dashboard. Alternatively, you may use the API and specify the replica ID within the `voiceId` field.

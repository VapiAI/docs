You can use your own custom Tavus replica with Vapi by following these steps.

An API subscription is required for this process. These steps are only needed for custom Tavus replicas, not for stock replicas on the Vapi platform.

    Visit the [Tavus pricing page](https://platform.tavus.io/billing) and subscribe to an API plan.

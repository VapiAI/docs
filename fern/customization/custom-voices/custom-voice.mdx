Vapi lets you use various providers with some preset voice. At the same time you can also create your own custom voices in the supported providers and use them with Vapi.

You can update the `voice` property in the assistant configuration when you are creating the assistant to use your custom voice.

```json
{
  "voice": {
    "provider": "deepgram",
    "voiceId": "your-voice-id"
  }
}
```

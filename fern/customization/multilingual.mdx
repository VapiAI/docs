## Overview

We support dozens of providers, giving you access to their available models for multilingual support.

Certain providers, like google and deepgram, have multilingual transcriber models that can transcribe audio in any language.

## Transcribers (Speech-to-Text)

In the dashboard's assistant tab, click on "transcriber" to view all of the available providers, languages and models for each. Each model offers different language options. 

## Voice (Text-to-Speech)

Each provider includes a voice tag in the name of their voice. For example, Azure offers the `es-ES-ElviraNeural` voice for Spanish. Go to voice tab in the assistants page to see all of the available models. 

### Example: Setting Up a Spanish Voice Assistant

```json
{
  "voice": {
    "provider": "azure",
    "voiceId": "es-ES-ElviraNeural"
  }
}
```

In this example, the voice `es-ES-ElviraNeural` from Azure supports Spanish. Replace `es-ES-ElviraNeural` with any other voice ID that supports your desired language.

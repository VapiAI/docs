Vapi supports Trieve as a knowledgebase provider, allowing you to leverage your existing document embeddings and chunks. While Vapi maintains its own storage of documents and vectors, you can seamlessly integrate with your Trieve datasets.

## Use Cases

### Existing Knowledge Base Migration

If you've already invested time in building and organizing your knowledge base in Trieve, you can continue using those vectors without having to reprocess your documents. This is particularly useful for:

- Large document collections that took significant time to process
- Carefully curated and cleaned datasets
- Custom-chunked documents with specific segmentation rules

### Parallel Systems

You might want to use both Trieve's native interface and Vapi simultaneously:

- Use Trieve's UI for content management and organization
- Leverage Vapi's chat interface and API capabilities
- Maintain consistency across both platforms

## Integration Steps

1. **Configure Trieve Credentials**

   - Navigate to the credentials page in your [Vapi dashboard](https://dashboard.vapi.ai/keys)
   - Add your Trieve API key for authentication from [Trieve](https://dashboard.trieve.ai/org/keys)

2. **Create a New Knowledge Base**

   - When setting up a new knowledge base, provide:
     - Your Trieve datasetId as the providerId.
     - Appropriate search configuration parameters.
     - Vapi will then automatically use your Trieve dataset as the knowledge base.

   Example configuration:

   ```json
   {
     "name": "trieve-byok",
     "provider": "trieve",
     "searchPlan": {
       "scoreThreshold": 0.2,
       "searchType": "semantic"
     },
     "createPlan": {
       "type": "import",
       "providerId": "<Your datasetId from Trieve>"
     }
   }
   ```

## Best Practices

- Ensure your Trieve API key has appropriate permissions
- Keep track of which datasetIds correspond to which knowledge bases
- Monitor vector synchronization to ensure consistency

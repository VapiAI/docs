title: Transcriber fallback configuration
subtitle: Configure fallback transcribers that activate automatically if your primary transcriber fails.
slug: customization/transcriber-fallback-plan
---

## Overview

Transcriber fallback configuration ensures your calls continue even if your primary speech-to-text provider experiences issues. Your assistant will sequentially fallback to the transcribers you configure, in the exact order you specify.

**Key benefits:**
- **Call continuity** during provider outages
- **Automatic failover** with no user intervention required
- **Provider diversity** to protect against single points of failure

<Note>
  Without a fallback plan configured, your call will end with an error if your chosen transcription provider fails.
</Note>

## How it works

When a transcriber failure occurs, Vapi will:
1. Detect the failure of the primary transcriber
2. Switch to the first fallback transcriber in your plan
3. Continue through your specified list if subsequent failures occur
4. Terminate only if all transcribers in your plan have failed

## Configure via Dashboard

<Steps>
  <Step title="Open Transcriber tab">
    Navigate to your assistant and select the **Transcriber** tab.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Expand Fallback Transcribers section">
    Scroll down to find the **Fallback Transcribers** collapsible section. A warning indicator appears if no fallback transcribers are configured.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Add a fallback transcriber">
    Click **Add Fallback Transcriber** to configure your first fallback:
    - Select a **provider** from the dropdown
    - Choose a **model** (if the provider offers multiple models)
    - Select a **language** for transcription
  </Step>
  <Step title="Configure provider-specific settings (optional)">
    Expand **Additional Configuration** to access provider-specific settings like numerals formatting, VAD settings, and confidence thresholds.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Add more fallbacks">
    Repeat to add additional fallback transcribers. Order matters—the first fallback in your list is tried first.
  </Step>
</Steps>

<Note>
  If HIPAA or PCI compliance is enabled on your account or assistant, only **Deepgram** and **Azure** transcribers will be available as fallback options.
</Note>

## Configure via API

Add the `fallbackPlan` property to your assistant's transcriber configuration, and specify the fallback transcribers within the `transcribers` property.

```json
{
  "transcriber": {
    "provider": "deepgram",
    "model": "nova-3",
    "language": "en",
    "fallbackPlan": {
      "transcribers": [
        {
          "provider": "assembly-ai",
          "speechModel": "universal-streaming-multilingual",
          "language": "en"
        },
        {
          "provider": "azure",
          "language": "en-US"
        }
      ]
    }
  }
}
```

## Best practices

- Use **different providers** for fallbacks to protect against provider-wide outages.
- Consider **language compatibility** when selecting fallbacks—ensure all fallback transcribers support your required languages.
- Test your fallback configuration to ensure smooth transitions between transcribers.
- For **HIPAA/PCI compliance**, ensure all fallbacks are compliant providers (Deepgram or Azure).

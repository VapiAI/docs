### Introduction


Conversation Analysis (CA) examines the structure and organization of human interactions, focusing on how participants manage conversations in real-time. We mimic this natural behavior in our API.

Key concepts include:

<AccordionGroup>
  
  <Accordion title="Turn-Taking Organization">
  Conversations are structured into turns, where typically one person speaks at a time. Speakers use Turn Construction Units (TCUs)—such as words, phrases, or clauses—that listeners recognize, allowing them to anticipate when a turn will end and when it's appropriate to speak. Transition Relevance Places (TRPs) are points where a change of speaker can occur. Turn allocation follows specific rules:

  - **Current speaker selects next**: The current speaker designates who speaks next.
  - **Self-selection**: If not selected, another participant may self-select to speak.
  - **Continuation**: If no one else speaks, the current speaker may continue.

  Silences are categorized as pauses (within a turn), gaps (between turns), or lapses (when no one speaks).

  <Accordion title="Sequence Organization">
  Conversations often involve sequences like adjacency pairs, where an initial utterance (e.g., a question) prompts a related response (e.g., an answer). These pairs can be expanded with pre-sequences (preparing for the main action), insert expansions (occurring between the initial and responsive actions), and post-expansions (following the main action).
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Preference Organization">
  Certain responses are socially preferred. For example, agreements or acceptances are typically delivered promptly and directly, while disagreements or refusals may be delayed or mitigated to maintain social harmony.
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Repair Mechanisms">
  Participants address problems in speaking, hearing, or understanding through repair strategies. Self-repair (the speaker corrects themselves) is generally preferred over other-repair (another person corrects the speaker), helping to maintain conversational flow and mutual understanding.
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Action Formation">
  Speakers perform actions (e.g., questioning, requesting, asserting) through their utterances. Understanding how these actions are constructed and interpreted is central to CA, as it reveals how participants achieve social objectives through conversation.
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Adjacency Pair">
  An adjacency pair is a fundamental unit of conversation consisting of two related utterances. The first part (e.g., a question) typically elicits a specific response (e.g., an answer). These pairs are essential for structuring conversations and ensuring coherence.

These foundational structures illustrate how individuals collaboratively produce and interpret talk in interaction, ensuring coherent and meaningful communication.

You might be wondering whether you should create an assistant using the `/assistant` endpoint with its `assistantId`. Or, can you just specify the assistant configuration when starting a call?

The `/assistant` endpoint exists for convenience so you don’t need to create your own assistants table.

<Accordion title="Use cases">
- You won't be adding more assistant properties on top of ours.
- You want to use the same assistant across multiple calls.
</Accordion>

Otherwise, you can just specify the assistant configuration when starting a call.

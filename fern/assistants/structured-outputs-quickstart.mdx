## Overview

This quickstart guide will help you set up structured outputs to automatically extract customer information from phone calls. In just a few minutes, you'll create a structured output, link it to an assistant, and test data extraction.

### What are structured outputs?

Structured outputs are AI-powered analysis and extraction tools that intelligently process conversation data after calls end. They go beyond simple data extraction to provide intelligent analysis and evaluation. They work by:

1. **Processing complete call context** - After the call ends, structured outputs analyze the full transcript, messages, tool call results, and call metadata
2. **Intelligent extraction & analysis** - Based on your schema, they can extract data, evaluate outcomes, analyze sentiment, determine success criteria, and summarize complex interactions
3. **Validating and formatting** - Results are validated against your schema rules and formatted into clean, structured JSON
4. **Delivering insights** - The processed data and insights are available via API or webhooks once analysis is complete

### When are structured outputs generated?

Structured outputs are processed:
- **After call completion** - The full conversation is analyzed once the call ends
- **Processing time** - Typically completes within a few seconds after call termination
- **Available via** - Call artifacts in the API response or webhook events

### What data do structured outputs have access to?

When processing, structured outputs can analyze:
- **Complete transcript** - The full conversation between assistant and customer
- **Messages history** - All messages exchanged during the call
- **Tool call results** - Outcomes from any tools or functions executed
- **Assistant context** - System prompts and configuration used during the call

### Why use structured outputs?

**Beyond simple data extraction:**
- **Call evaluation** - Determine if objectives were met (appointment booked, issue resolved)
- **Sentiment analysis** - Understand customer satisfaction and emotional state
- **CSAT scoring** - Extract customer satisfaction scores from feedback
- **Intelligent summaries** - Generate contextual summaries of complex conversations
- **Success metrics** - Evaluate agent performance and call outcomes

**Operational benefits:**
- **Automate data entry** - No more manual transcription or form filling
- **Ensure consistency** - Every call captures the same structured information
- **Enable integrations** - Automatically sync data to CRMs, ticketing systems, or databases
- **Improve analytics** - Structured data is easier to analyze and report on

## What you'll build

A customer support assistant that automatically extracts:
- Customer name and contact details
- Issue description and priority
- Requested follow-up actions

## Step 1: Create your structured output

Define what information you want to extract using a [JSON Schema](https://json-schema.org/learn/getting-started-step-by-step). JSON Schema is a standard for describing data structures - [learn more about JSON Schema here](https://json-schema.org/understanding-json-schema/).

<Note>
In the API approach, you'll need to save the returned `id` to attach it to an assistant. In the Dashboard, you can attach it directly when creating the structured output.
</Note>

## Step 2: Create and test a call

Now test your structured output by making a call.

<Note>
**Prerequisites**: You need an assistant already created with:
- The structured output from Step 1 attached in `artifactPlan.structuredOutputIds`
- A model and voice configured
- System prompt appropriate for your use case

You can create an assistant via the Dashboard or API, then use its ID in the examples below.
</Note>

<Tabs>
  <Tab title="Dashboard">
    <Steps>
      <Step title="Start a test call">
        1. Navigate to your assistant (from **Assistants** in the sidebar)
        2. Ensure your structured output is attached in the **Artifact Plan** section
        3. Click **Talk to Assistant** in the top right corner
        4. The assistant will start speaking
      </Step>

      <Step title="Have a conversation">
        Try saying: "Hi, my name is John Smith. My email is john@example.com. I'm having trouble logging into my account - it keeps showing an error message. This is pretty urgent for me."
      </Step>

      <Step title="End the call">
        Click **End Call** when you're done testing

<Tip>
During the call, try saying something like: "Hi, my name is John Smith. My email is john@example.com. I'm having trouble logging into my account - it keeps showing an error message. This is pretty urgent for me."
</Tip>

## Step 3: Retrieve extracted data

After the call ends, retrieve the extracted information:

<Tabs>
  <Tab title="Dashboard">
    <Steps>
      <Step title="View call details">
        1. Navigate to **Call Logs** in the left sidebar
        2. Click on your recent call to view details
      </Step>

      <Step title="Check extracted data">
        1. In the call details, find the **Structured Outputs** section
        2. View the extracted JSON data for your "Support Ticket" output
        3. The data will be displayed in a formatted JSON view showing each output with its ID, name, and result
      </Step>
    </Steps>

    ### How structured outputs appear in Call Logs
    
    When you view a call in the Call Logs page, structured outputs are displayed in the following format:
    
    ```json

    **Structure explanation:**
    - **Root level**: Contains output IDs (UUIDs) as keys
    - **name**: The name of the structured output configuration
    - **result**: The actual extracted data based on your schema
      - For object schemas: Contains the nested structure with all extracted fields
      - For boolean schemas: Contains `true` or `false`
      - For string schemas: Contains the extracted text
      - For number schemas: Contains the numeric value
    
    <Note>
    If you have multiple structured outputs attached to an assistant, each will appear with its own UUID key in the structuredOutputs object.

### Expected output

The extracted data (the `result` field from the API response) will look like this:

```json
{
  "customer": {
    "name": "John Smith",
    "email": "john@example.com",
    "phone": "+1234567890"
  },
  "issue": {
    "description": "Unable to login to account, receiving error message",
    "category": "technical",
    "priority": "urgent"
  },
  "followUp": {
    "required": true,
    "method": "email",
    "notes": "Customer needs immediate assistance with login issue"
  }
}
```

<Note>
When accessing via API, this data is nested inside the structured output object at `call.artifact.structuredOutputs[outputId].result`. The Dashboard shows the complete structure including the output ID and name.
</Note>

## HIPAA Compliance & Storage Settings

<Warning>
**Important for HIPAA users:** When HIPAA mode is enabled, Vapi does not store structured outputs by default. This protects privacy but limits your ability to view structured outputs in Insights and Call Logs.
</Warning>

### Understanding the default behavior

When your organization or assistant has HIPAA mode enabled (`hipaaEnabled: true`):
- **Structured outputs are NOT stored** - Results are generated but not persisted in Vapi's systems
- **Limited visibility** - You cannot view outputs in the Dashboard's Call Logs or Insights
- **Privacy first** - This ensures sensitive data is not retained
- **Webhook access only** - You can still receive outputs via webhooks during the call

This default behavior protects patient privacy and ensures compliance with HIPAA regulations.

### Enabling storage for non-sensitive outputs

For structured outputs that extract **non-sensitive, non-PHI information**, you can override this behavior using the `compliancePlan.forceStoreOnHipaaEnabled` setting.

<Warning>
**Your responsibility:** You must ensure that any structured output with storage enabled does NOT extract or generate PHI or sensitive data.
</Warning>

#### Safe use cases for storage override

Enable storage for these types of non-sensitive outputs:

- **Boolean outcomes**: `appointmentBooked: true/false`, `callSuccessful: true/false`
- **General categories**: `issueCategory: "billing" | "technical" | "general"`
- **Satisfaction scores**: `csatScore: 1-10`
- **Call metrics**: `sentiment: "positive" | "neutral" | "negative"`
- **Success indicators**: `issueResolved: boolean`, `followUpRequired: boolean`

#### Never enable storage for these

**Do not** enable storage for outputs that extract:
- Patient names, dates of birth, or contact information
- Diagnosis, treatment, or medication information
- Medical record numbers or identifiers
- Social security numbers
- Credit card or payment details

### Configuration examples

    }
)
```
  </Tab>
</Tabs>

<Warning>
**IMPORTANT:** Only set `forceStoreOnHipaaEnabled: true` if you are certain your structured output does NOT extract PHI or sensitive data. Review your schema carefully before enabling storage.
</Warning>

### Best practices for HIPAA compliance

1. **Default to privacy**: Keep storage disabled for all outputs that might contain PHI
2. **Review schemas carefully**: Ensure your extraction logic cannot accidentally capture sensitive data
3. **Use specific schemas**: Design narrow schemas that target only non-sensitive data
4. **Test thoroughly**: Verify outputs don't contain PHI before enabling storage
5. **Document decisions**: Maintain records of which outputs have storage enabled and why
6. **Regular audits**: Periodically review stored outputs to ensure compliance

For more information about HIPAA compliance with Vapi, see our [HIPAA Compliance Guide](/security-and-privacy/hipaa).

## Common patterns

### Multiple extractions

You can attach multiple structured outputs to extract different types of data:

```javascript
{
  artifactPlan: {
    structuredOutputIds: [
      "550e8400-e29b-41d4-a716-446655440001",    // Customer details extraction
      "550e8400-e29b-41d4-a716-446655440002",    // Appointment requests extraction  
      "550e8400-e29b-41d4-a716-446655440003"     // Satisfaction feedback extraction
    ]
  }
}
```

<Note>The `structuredOutputIds` are UUIDs returned when you create each structured output configuration.</Note>

### Example: Intelligent analysis with multiple outputs

Structured outputs can perform sophisticated analysis beyond simple data extraction. Here's a real example showing various types of intelligent evaluation:

```json
{
  "2ca00f20-f2c3-4d74-af2e-52842be5885c": {
    "name": "informationOnFileIsCorrect",
    "result": false
  },
  "4748e1aa-6c7a-49e6-bbde-c4365ef69c6e": {
    "name": "Appointment Rescheduled",
    "result": false
  },
  "4d4bac33-2cea-43d4-a3b3-4554932b8933": {
    "name": "CSAT",
    "result": 8
  },
  "7898e478-c8dc-4ff8-a3f6-4a46555a957f": {
    "name": "Appointment Booked",
    "result": true
  },
  "a0ca58b1-c343-4628-b088-bf53aabacab9": {
    "name": "Call Summary",
    "result": "The user called to schedule a consultation appointment for next week, specifically on Wednesday afternoon..."
  },
  "b5a390d8-87c5-4015-b1ad-ed237201bdf0": {
    "name": "Success Evaluation - Pass/Fail",
    "result": true
  }
}
```

This example demonstrates intelligent extraction capabilities:
- **Call outcome evaluation**: `Appointment Booked` (true) - Analyzed if the call's objective was achieved
- **Data verification**: `informationOnFileIsCorrect` (false) - Evaluated if customer data needed updates
- **Success metrics**: `Success Evaluation - Pass/Fail` (true) - Determined overall call success based on multiple criteria
- **CSAT extraction**: `CSAT` (8) - Extracted satisfaction score from customer feedback
- **Intelligent summarization**: `Call Summary` - Generated contextual summary of the conversation
- **Process tracking**: `Appointment Rescheduled` (false) - Tracked specific actions taken during the call

Each output analyzes the complete call context including transcript, tool results, and metadata to provide actionable insights.

### Validation patterns

Common validation patterns for reliable extraction:

```json
{
  "email": {
    "type": "string",
    "format": "email",
    "pattern": "^[a-zA-Z0-9._%+-]+@[a-zA-Z0-9.-]+\\.[a-zA-Z]{2,}$"
  },
  "phone": {
    "type": "string",
    "pattern": "^\\+?[1-9]\\d{1,14}$"
  },
  "zipCode": {
    "type": "string",
    "pattern": "^\\d{5}(-\\d{4})?$"
  }
}
```

## Tips for success

<Note>
**Best practices for reliable extraction:**
- Start with required fields only for critical data
- Use enums for categorical data to ensure consistency
- Add descriptions to help the AI understand context
- Test with real conversations before production use
- Monitor extraction success rates and iterate on schemas
</Note>

## Troubleshooting

| Issue | Solution |
|-------|----------|
| No data extracted | Verify the information was mentioned in the call and check schema validity |
| Partial extraction | Make non-critical fields optional and simplify nested structures |
| Incorrect values | Add more specific validation patterns and field descriptions |
| Extraction fails | Check API logs, verify assistant configuration, and test with simpler schema |

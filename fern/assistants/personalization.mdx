## Overview

Personalization lets you include customer-specific information in your voice assistant conversations. When a customer calls, your server can provide data about that customer, which is then used to tailor the conversation in real time.

This approach is ideal for use cases like customer support, account management, or any scenario where the assistant should reference details unique to the caller.

## How Personalization Works

<Steps>
  <Step title="Customer Calls Your Number">
    When a call comes in, Vapi sends a request to your server instead of using a fixed assistant configuration.
  </Step>

  <Step title="Your Server Looks Up the Caller">
    Your server receives the request, identifies the caller (for example, by phone number), and fetches relevant customer data from your database or CRM.
  </Step>

  <Step title="Your Server Responds with Assistant Details">
    Your server responds to Vapi with either:
    - An existing assistant ID and a set of dynamic variables to personalize the conversation, or
    - A complete assistant configuration, with customer data embedded directly in the prompts or instructions.
  </Step>

  <Step title="Vapi Handles the Call">
    Vapi uses the personalized assistant configuration or variables to guide the conversation, referencing the customer's information as needed.
  </Step>
</Steps>

## Prerequisites

- A Vapi phone number
- A created Vapi Assistant
- A server endpoint to receive Vapi's requests

## Implementation

<Steps>
  <Step title="Add Dynamic Variables to Your Assistant">
    Use variable placeholders in your assistant's instructions or messages with the `{{variable_name}}` syntax.

    Example:  
    `"Hello {{customerName}}! I see you've been a {{accountType}} customer since {{joinDate}}."`
  </Step>

  <Step title="Configure Your Phone Number to Use Your Server">
    Update your phone number so that Vapi sends incoming call events to your server, rather than using a static assistant.

    ```json
    PATCH /phone-number/{id}
    {
      "assistantId": null,
      "squadId": null,
      "server": {
        "url": "https://your-server.com/api/assistant-selector"
      }
    }
    ```

    <Note>
      Your server must respond within 7.5 seconds, or the call will fail.
    </Note>
  </Step>

  <Step title="Implement Your Server Endpoint">
    Your server should handle POST requests from Vapi and return either:

    **Option 1: Use an Existing Assistant with Dynamic Variables**

    ```javascript
    app.post("/api/assistant-selector", async (req, res) => {
      if (req.body.message?.type === "assistant-request") {
        const phoneNumber = req.body.call.from.phoneNumber;
        const customer = await crmAPI.getCustomerByPhone(phoneNumber);

        res.json({
          assistantId: "asst_customersupport",
          assistantOverrides: {
            variableValues: {
              customerName: customer.name,
              accountType: customer.tier,
              joinDate: customer.createdAt
            }
          }
        });
      }
    });
    ```

    **Option 2: Return a Complete Assistant Configuration**

    ```javascript
    app.post("/api/assistant-selector", async (req, res) => {
      if (req.body.message?.type === "assistant-request") {
        const phoneNumber = req.body.call.from.phoneNumber;
        const customer = await crmAPI.getCustomerByPhone(phoneNumber);

        res.json({
          assistant: {
            name: "Dynamic Customer Support Assistant",
            model: {
              provider: "openai",
              model: "gpt-4",
              messages: [{
                role: "system",
                content: `You are helping ${customer.name}, a ${customer.tier} member since ${customer.createdAt}.`
              }]
            },
            voice: {
              provider: "11labs",
              voiceId: "shimmer"
            }
          }
        });
      }
    });
    ```
  </Step>
</Steps>

## Error Handling

If your server encounters an error or cannot find the customer, return a response like this to end the call with a spoken message:

```json
{
  "error": "Unable to find customer record. Please try again later."
}
```

## Common Issues

<Note>
- Use the exact `{{variable_name}}` syntax for variables in your assistant configuration.
- Your server must respond within 7.5 seconds.
- Implement fallbacks for missing or incomplete customer data.
- Ensure your endpoint is highly available to avoid missed calls.
</Note>

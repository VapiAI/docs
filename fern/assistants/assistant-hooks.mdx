# Assistant Hooks

Assistant hooks allow you to configure actions that will be performed when specific events occur during a call. Currently, hooks support the `call.ending` event, which triggers when a call is ending.

## Usage

Hooks are defined in the `hooks` array of an assistant. Each hook consists of:

- `on`: The event that triggers the hook (currently only supports `call.ending`)
- `do`: The actions to perform when the hook triggers (currently only supports `transfer`)
- `filters`: Optional conditions that must be met for the hook to trigger

The `call.endedReason` field in filters can be set to any of the [call ended reasons](https://docs.vapi.ai/api-reference/calls/get#response.body.endedReason). The transfer destination type follows the same schema as the [transfer call tool destinations](https://docs.vapi.ai/api-reference/tools/create#request.body.transferCall.destinations).

Note: Using `"oneOf": ["pipeline-error"]` acts as a catch-all filter that matches any pipeline-related error reason. This is useful when you want to handle all types of pipeline failures with the same transfer action.

## Example: Transfer on Pipeline Error

This example shows how to transfer a call to a fallback number when a pipeline error occurs. The hook will trigger when the call is ending due to a pipeline error, and transfer the call to a specified phone number:

```bash
curl -X PATCH "https://api.vapi.ai/assistant/<id>" \
     -H "Authorization: Bearer <auth>" \
     -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
     -d '{
  "hooks": [{
    "on": "call.ending",
    "filters": [{
      "type": "oneOf",
      "key": "call.endedReason",
      "oneOf": ["pipeline-error"]
    }],
    "do": [{
      "type": "transfer",
      "destination": {
        "type": "number",
        "number": "+1234567890",
        "callerId": "+1987654321"
      }
    }]
  }]
}'
```

You can also transfer to a SIP destination:

```bash
curl -X PATCH "https://api.vapi.ai/assistant/<id>" \
     -H "Authorization: Bearer <auth>" \
     -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
     -d '{
  "hooks": [{
    "on": "call.ending",
    "filters": [{
      "type": "oneOf",
      "key": "call.endedReason",
      "oneOf": ["pipeline-error"]
    }],
    "do": [{
      "type": "transfer",
      "destination": {
        "type": "sip",
        "sipUri": "sip:user@domain.com"
      }
    }]
  }]
}'
```

Common use cases for hooks include:
- Transferring to a human agent on errors
- Routing to a fallback system if the assistant fails
- Ensuring calls are handled gracefully in edge cases

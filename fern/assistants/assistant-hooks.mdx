# Assistant Hooks

Assistant hooks allow you to configure actions that will be performed when specific events occur during a call. Currently, hooks support the `call.ending` event (which is triggered when a call is ending), `assistant.speech.interrupted` (when the assistant's speech is interrupted), and `customer.speech.interrupted` (when the customer's speech is interrupted)

## Usage

Hooks are defined in the `hooks` array of an assistant. Each hook consists of:

- `on`: The event that triggers the hook (supports `call.ending`, `assistant.speech.interrupted`, and `customer.speech.interrupted`)
- `do`: The actions to perform when the hook triggers (supports `transfer`, `function`, and `say`)
- `filters`: Optional conditions that must be met for the hook to trigger

The `call.endedReason` field in filters can be set to any of the [call ended reasons](https://docs.vapi.ai/api-reference/calls/get#response.body.endedReason). The transfer destination type follows the same schema as the [transfer call tool destinations](https://docs.vapi.ai/api-reference/tools/create#request.body.transferCall.destinations).

Note: Using `"oneOf": ["pipeline-error"]` acts as a catch-all filter that matches any pipeline-related error reason. This is useful when you want to handle all types of pipeline failures with the same transfer action.

## Example: Transfer on Pipeline Error

This example shows how to transfer a call to a fallback number when a pipeline error occurs. The hook will trigger when the call is ending due to a pipeline error, and transfer the call to a specified phone number:

```bash
curl -X PATCH "https://api.vapi.ai/assistant/<id>" \
     -H "Authorization: Bearer <auth>" \
     -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
     -d '{
  "hooks": [{
    "on": "call.ending",
    "filters": [{
      "type": "oneOf",
      "key": "call.endedReason",
      "oneOf": ["pipeline-error"]
    }],
    "do": [{
      "type": "transfer",
      "destination": {
        "type": "number",
        "number": "+1234567890",
        "callerId": "+1987654321"
      }
    }]
  }]
}'
```

You can also transfer to a SIP destination:

```bash
curl -X PATCH "https://api.vapi.ai/assistant/<id>" \
     -H "Authorization: Bearer <auth>" \
     -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
     -d '{
  "hooks": [{
    "on": "call.ending",
    "filters": [{
      "type": "oneOf",
      "key": "call.endedReason",
      "oneOf": ["pipeline-error"]
    }],
    "do": [{
      "type": "transfer",
      "destination": {
        "type": "sip",
        "sipUri": "sip:user@domain.com"
      }
    }]
  }]
}'
```

## Example: Combined Actions on Pipeline Error

This example demonstrates how to combine multiple actions (say, function, and transfer) when a pipeline error occurs. The hook will first say a message, then call a function, and finally transfer the call:

```bash
curl -X PATCH "https://api.vapi.ai/assistant/<id>" \
     -H "Authorization: Bearer <auth>" \
     -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
     -d '{
  "hooks": [{
    "on": "call.ending",
    "filters": [{
      "type": "oneOf",
      "key": "call.endedReason",
      "oneOf": ["pipeline-error"]
    }],
    "do": [
      {
        "type": "say",
        "exact": "I apologize for the technical difficulty. Let me transfer you to our support team."
      },
      {
        "type": "function",
        "function": {
          "name": "log_error",
          "parameters": {
            "type": "object",
            "properties": {
              "error_type": {
                "type": "string",
                "value": "pipeline_error"
              }
            }
          },
          "description": "Logs the error details for monitoring"
        },
        "async": true,
        "server": {
          "url": "https://your-server.com/api"
        }
      },
      {
        "type": "transfer",
        "destination": {
          "type": "number",
          "number": "+1234567890",
          "callerId": "+1987654321"
        }
      }
    ]
  }]
}'
```

## Example: Handling Speech Interruptions

This example demonstrates how to handle when the assistant's speech is interrupted by the customer. The hook will respond with a polite acknowledgment:

```bash
curl -X PATCH "https://api.vapi.ai/assistant/<id>" \
     -H "Authorization: Bearer <auth>" \
     -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
     -d '{
  "hooks": [{
    "on": "assistant.speech.interrupted",
    "do": [{
      "type": "say",
      "exact": ["Sorry about that", "Go ahead", "Please continue"]
    }]
  }]
}'
```

You can also handle customer speech interruptions in a similar way:

```bash
curl -X PATCH "https://api.vapi.ai/assistant/<id>" \
     -H "Authorization: Bearer <auth>" \
     -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
     -d '{
  "hooks": [{
    "on": "customer.speech.interrupted",
    "do": [{
      "type": "say",
      "exact": "I apologize for interrupting. Please continue."
    }]
  }]
}'
```

Common use cases for hooks include:
- Transferring to a human agent on errors
- Routing to a fallback system if the assistant fails
- Ensuring calls are handled gracefully in edge cases
- Handling customer/assistant interruptions

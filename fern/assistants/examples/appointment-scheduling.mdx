## Overview

Build an AI-powered appointment scheduling assistant that handles inbound calls for booking, rescheduling, and canceling appointments. This approach uses a single Assistant with tools for calendar availability, customer lookups, and confirmations.

**Assistant Capabilities:**
* Real-time availability checks and booking
* Reschedule and cancel with confirmation
* Customer verification and data lookups
* SMS/email confirmations via tools

**What You'll Build:**
* An assistant with a focused prompt for scheduling flows
* Tools for calendar availability and booking
* Optional CSV knowledge bases for customers/services
* A phone number attached to your assistant

## Prerequisites

* A [Vapi account](https://dashboard.vapi.ai/)
* Google Calendar or a scheduling backend

## 1. Prepare data (optional)

Use sample CSVs for customers, services, and appointments during development.

<Steps>
  <Step title="Download sample spreadsheets">
    <div className="flex gap-2">
      <Download src="../../static/spreadsheets/appointment-scheduling/services.csv">
        <Button intent="primary">Download services.csv</Button>
      </Download>
      <Download src="../../static/spreadsheets/appointment-scheduling/customers.csv">
        <Button intent="primary">Download customers.csv</Button>
      </Download>
      <Download src="../../static/spreadsheets/appointment-scheduling/appointments.csv">
        <Button intent="primary">Download appointments.csv</Button>
      </Download>
    </div>
  </Step>
  <Step title="Upload files (optional)">
    <Tabs>
      <Tab title="Dashboard">
        1. Open your [Vapi Dashboard](https://dashboard.vapi.ai) → Files
        2. Upload the three CSVs and note their file IDs
        
        <video autoPlay loop muted src="../../static/videos/upload-files.mp4" type="video/mp4" style={{ aspectRatio: '16 / 9', width: '100%' }} />
      </Tab>
      <Tab title="TypeScript (Server SDK)">
        ```typescript
        import { VapiClient } from "@vapi-ai/server-sdk";
        import fs from "fs";

        const vapi = new VapiClient({ token: process.env.VAPI_API_KEY! });

        async function upload(file: string) {
          const res = await vapi.files.create({ file: fs.createReadStream(file) });
          console.log(file, res.id);
          return res.id;
        }

        const servicesFileId = await upload("services.csv");
        const customersFileId = await upload("customers.csv");
        const appointmentsFileId = await upload("appointments.csv");
        ```
      </Tab>
      <Tab title="Python (Server SDK)">
        ```python
        import requests, os

        def upload(path: str):
            r = requests.post(
                "https://api.vapi.ai/file",
                headers={"Authorization": f"Bearer {os.getenv('VAPI_API_KEY')}"},
                files={"file": open(path, "rb")},
            )
            r.raise_for_status()
            print(path, r.json()["id"]) 
            return r.json()["id"]

        services_file_id = upload("services.csv")
        customers_file_id = upload("customers.csv")
        appointments_file_id = upload("appointments.csv")
        ```
      </Tab>
    </Tabs>
  </Step>
</Steps>

## 2. Create calendar tools

Use the Google Calendar integration for availability and booking, or your own API via a custom tool.

<Tabs>
  <Tab title="Use Google Calendar (recommended)">
    See: [Google Calendar Integration](/tools/google-calendar)
    
    Configure tools for:
    - `check_availability(service, date)`
    - `book_appointment(customer, service, time)`
    - `reschedule_appointment(appointmentId, time)`
    - `cancel_appointment(appointmentId)`
  </Tab>
  <Tab title="Custom tools (HTTP)">
    See: [Custom Tools](/tools/custom-tools)
    
    Define function tools that call your scheduling backend. Attach CSV knowledge bases (customers/services) if using the sample data above.
  </Tab>
</Tabs>

## 3. Create the assistant

<Tabs>
  <Tab title="Dashboard">
    <Steps>
      <Step title="Create assistant">
        - Go to Assistants → Create Assistant → Blank template
        - Name it `Receptionist`
      </Step>
      <Step title="Configure system prompt">
        ```txt title="System Prompt" maxLines=12
        You are an AI receptionist for a barbershop. Your goals:
        1) Verify the customer
        2) Offer booking, rescheduling, or cancellation
        3) Confirm details and send a confirmation

        When needed, call tools: check_availability, book_appointment, reschedule_appointment, cancel_appointment.
        Keep replies under 30 words. Confirm date/time clearly.
        ```
      </Step>
      <Step title="Attach tools">
        Add your scheduling tools to the assistant and publish.
      </Step>
    </Steps>
  </Tab>
  <Tab title="TypeScript (Server SDK)">
    ```typescript
    import { VapiClient } from "@vapi-ai/server-sdk";

    const vapi = new VapiClient({ token: process.env.VAPI_API_KEY! });

    const systemPrompt = `You are an AI receptionist for a barbershop. Verify the customer, then offer booking, rescheduling, or cancellation. Use scheduling tools when needed. Keep replies under 30 words.`;

    const assistant = await vapi.assistants.create({
      name: "Receptionist",
      firstMessage: "Welcome to Tony's Barbershop! How can I help you today?",
      model: {
        provider: "openai",
        model: "gpt-4o",
        messages: [{ role: "system", content: systemPrompt }],
        // toolIds: [ "CHECK_AVAILABILITY_ID", "BOOK_ID", "RESCHEDULE_ID", "CANCEL_ID" ]
      }
    });
    ```
  </Tab>
  <Tab title="Python (Server SDK)">
    ```python
    from vapi import Vapi
    import os

    client = Vapi(token=os.getenv("VAPI_API_KEY"))

    assistant = client.assistants.create(
        name="Receptionist",
        first_message="Welcome to Tony's Barbershop! How can I help you today?",
        model={
            "provider": "openai",
            "model": "gpt-4o",
            "messages": [{"role": "system", "content": "You are an AI receptionist for a barbershop. Verify the customer, then handle booking/rescheduling/cancel."}]
        }
    )
    ```
  </Tab>
</Tabs>

## 4. Test and validate

<Steps>
  <Step title="Attach a phone number">
    Create a phone number and assign your assistant. See [Phone calls quickstart](/quickstart/phone).
  </Step>
  <Step title="Test scenarios">
    - New booking → check availability → book → confirm
    - Reschedule existing appointment → confirm
    - Cancel appointment → confirm
  </Step>
</Steps>

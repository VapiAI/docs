description: Force immediate voice transmission with VAPI's flush syntax for real-time interactions
---

## Overview

The flush syntax is a VAPI audio control token that forces immediate transmission of LLM output to voice providers, eliminating buffering delays for real-time voice interactions.

**When to use flush syntax:**

- Acknowledge user requests immediately during processing
- Provide feedback during long-running tool executions
- Create natural conversation pauses
- Support custom LLM integrations with processing delays

<Tip>
  Use flush strategicallyâ€”overuse can cause audio fragmentation and degrade
  conversation quality.
</Tip>

## How it works

The flush syntax bypasses normal buffering to provide immediate audio feedback:

1. **Detection**: VAPI scans LLM output for flush syntax using regex pattern
2. **Split**: Text is divided at the flush position
3. **Immediate Send**: Content before flush is sent instantly to voice provider
4. **Continue**: Remaining text follows normal buffering

<CodeBlocks>
```typescript title="Processing Example"
const { sendToTTS, flush, remainingBuffer } = ttsBuffer(buffer, voice);
if (sendToTTS.length > 0) {
  pushBuffer(sendToTTS, flush); // flush=true triggers immediate send
  buffer = remainingBuffer;
}
```
```python title="Conceptual Flow"
# 1. LLM generates: "I'm processing your request... <flush /> Here's the result"
# 2. VAPI detects flush syntax
# 3. Sends "I'm processing your request..." immediately to voice
# 4. Continues with "Here's the result" using normal buffering
```
</CodeBlocks>

## Syntax formats

VAPI supports three flush formats with case-insensitive matching:

<CodeBlocks>
  ```html title="Self-closing (Recommended)"
  <flush />
  ``` ```html title="Opening tag"
  <flush>``` ```html title="Closing tag"</flush>
  ```
</CodeBlocks>

<Note>
All formats use regex pattern `/<\s*flush\s*\/?>|<\s*\/\s*flush\s*>/i` allowing whitespace variations.
</Note>

## Configuration requirements

Flush syntax requires proper voice configuration:

<CodeBlocks>
```json title="Assistant Configuration"
{
  "voice": {
    "chunkPlan": {
      "enabled": true  // Required for flush to work
    }
  }
}
```
```typescript title="TypeScript SDK"
const assistant = await vapi.assistants.create({
  voice: {
    chunkPlan: {
      enabled: true
    }
  }
  // ... other configuration
});
```
</CodeBlocks>

<Warning>
  Flush will NOT work when `chunkPlan.enabled: false`. The tags will appear in
  voice output instead of being processed.
</Warning>

## Usage examples

### Basic acknowledgment

```javascript
"I'm processing your request... <flush /> Let me check that for you.";
```

### Tool processing feedback

```javascript
"Looking up that information... <flush /> This may take a moment.";
```

### Conversation flow

```javascript
"That's a great question. <flush /> Based on the data I have...";
```

### Custom LLM integration

```javascript
"Here's your answer: 42. <flush /> Would you like an explanation?";
```

  <Card title="Acknowledge requests" icon="check">
    Immediately confirm you've received and understood the user's request
  </Card>
  <Card title="Long operations" icon="clock">
    Provide feedback during tool calls or processing that takes time
  </Card>
  <Card title="Natural pauses" icon="pause">

</CardGroup>

### When to avoid flush

- **Every response** - Causes audio fragmentation
- **Mid-sentence** - Breaks natural speech flow
- **Short responses** - Normal buffering is sufficient
- **Multiple per response** - Can create choppy audio

### Implementation guidelines

1. **Place at natural boundaries** - Use between complete thoughts or sentences
2. **Test with your voice provider** - Effectiveness varies by provider
3. **Monitor conversation quality** - Ensure audio remains smooth and natural
4. **Document usage** - Include in code comments for team understanding

## Advanced usage

### Dynamic insertion

```typescript
const acknowledgment = "I understand your request";
const detailedResponse = await processRequest(userInput);
const responseWithFlush = `${acknowledgment} <flush /> ${detailedResponse}`;
```

### System prompt integration

```javascript
const systemPrompt = `When providing lengthy responses, use <flush /> after acknowledging the user's request to provide immediate feedback.`;
```

### Nested handling

```javascript
"Starting process... <flush> Step 1 complete </flush> Moving to step 2...";
```

## Troubleshooting

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="Flush tags appear in voice output">
    **Cause**: `chunkPlan.enabled` is set to `false` or missing **Solution**: -
    Verify `chunkPlan.enabled: true` in voice configuration - Check assistant
    configuration in dashboard or API calls - Test with a minimal configuration
    to isolate the issue
  </Accordion>

{" "}
<Accordion title="Syntax not recognized">
  **Cause**: Malformed flush syntax or typos **Solution**: - Use exact formats:
  `<flush />
  `, `<flush>`, or `</flush>` - Avoid extra parameters or attributes - Check for
  typos in tag spelling
</Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Audio sounds choppy or fragmented">
    **Cause**: Overuse of flush syntax 
    **Solution**: 
    - Reduce flush frequency in responses 
    - Place only at sentence boundaries 
    - Test with real users to
    validate experience
  </Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>

## Technical considerations

### Provider compatibility

- **Effectiveness varies** by voice provider
- **Test thoroughly** with your chosen provider
- **Monitor performance** impact on response times

### Cost implications

- **Increased API calls** to voice provider
- **Higher usage** on usage-based pricing
- **Monitor billing** if using flush frequently

### VAPI-only feature

- **Platform exclusive** - not available on other voice platforms
- **Configuration dependent** - requires chunking enabled
- **Version specific** - ensure using compatible VAPI version

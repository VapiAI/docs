## Overview

Vapi provides comprehensive call recording capabilities that allow you to capture, store, and analyze voice conversations for quality assurance, training, and compliance purposes.

**Call recording enables you to:**
- Monitor conversation quality and assistant performance
- Train and improve your voice AI models
- Ensure compliance with regulatory requirements
- Analyze customer interactions for insights

## Recording Configuration

### Enable Recording

You can enable call recording at the assistant level or per individual call:

<CodeBlocks>
```json title="Assistant Configuration"
{
  "name": "Customer Support Assistant",
  "recordingEnabled": true,
  "model": {
    "provider": "openai",
    "model": "gpt-4"
  },
  "voice": {
    "provider": "11labs",
    "voiceId": "harry"
  }
}
```

```json title="Per-Call Configuration"
{
  "assistant": {
    "name": "Support Agent"
  },
  "recordingEnabled": true,
  "phoneNumberId": "your-phone-number-id"
}
```
</CodeBlocks>

### Recording Options

Configure recording behavior with these options:

- **`recordingEnabled`**: Enable or disable recording for this assistant/call
- **`recordingChannelCount`**: Number of audio channels to record (1 for mono, 2 for stereo)
- **`recordingFormat`**: Audio format for recordings (mp3, wav, etc.)

## Storage Options

### Default Storage

By default, Vapi stores recordings securely in the cloud:

- Recordings are encrypted at rest and in transit
- Access is controlled through your API credentials
- Recordings are automatically cleaned up based on your retention policy

### Custom Storage

For advanced use cases, you can configure custom storage:

<CodeBlocks>
```json title="S3 Storage Configuration"
{
  "recordingEnabled": true,
  "recordingPath": "https://your-bucket.s3.amazonaws.com/recordings/",
  "recordingCredentials": {
    "provider": "aws",
    "region": "us-east-1",
    "accessKeyId": "your-access-key",
    "secretAccessKey": "your-secret-key"
  }
}
```

```json title="Google Cloud Storage"
{
  "recordingEnabled": true,
  "recordingPath": "gs://your-bucket/recordings/",
  "recordingCredentials": {
    "provider": "gcp",
    "serviceAccountKey": "your-service-account-json"
  }
}
```
</CodeBlocks>

## Accessing Recordings

### Via Dashboard

1. Navigate to **Calls** in your Vapi dashboard
2. Select a specific call from the list
3. Click on the **Recording** tab to play or download the audio

### Via API

Retrieve recording URLs programmatically:

```typescript
import { VapiClient } from "@vapi-ai/server-sdk";

const client = new VapiClient({ token: "your-api-key" });

// Get call details including recording URL
const call = await client.calls.get("call-id");
console.log("Recording URL:", call.recordingUrl);
```

## Privacy and Compliance

### Legal Considerations

**Important**: Call recording laws vary by jurisdiction. Ensure compliance with:

- **Consent requirements** - Inform participants about recording
- **Data protection** regulations (GDPR, CCPA, etc.)
- **Industry standards** (PCI DSS, HIPAA, etc.)

### Best Practices

- **Inform callers** about recording at the start of conversations
- **Secure storage** with encryption and access controls
- **Retention policies** to automatically delete old recordings
- **Access logs** to track who accesses recordings

<Warning>
  Always comply with local laws regarding call recording. Some jurisdictions require explicit consent from all parties before recording.
</Warning>

## Recording Analysis

### Transcription

Recorded calls are automatically transcribed for analysis:

```json

  "transcript": [
    {
      "role": "assistant",
      "message": "Hello! How can I help you today?",
      "time": 0.5
    },
    {
      "role": "user",

## Overview

Vapi's artifact plan system provides comprehensive call recording, logging, and transcription capabilities that allow you to capture, store, and analyze voice conversations for quality assurance, training, and compliance purposes.

**Artifact plans enable you to:**
- Record audio conversations for quality monitoring
- Generate detailed call logs for debugging and analysis
- Create transcripts for conversation analysis
- Store artifacts in custom storage or Vapi's secure cloud
- Monitor conversation quality and assistant performance
- Ensure compliance with regulatory requirements

## Use Cases

### Payment Processing Flows

Protect sensitive payment information by using a middle assistant with all artifacts disabled:

```json
{
  "squad": {
    "members": [
      {
        "assistant": {
          "name": "Service Assistant",
          "artifactPlan": {
            "recordingEnabled": true,
            "loggingEnabled": true,
            "transcriptPlan": { "enabled": true }
          }
        }
      },
      {
        "assistant": {
          "name": "Payment Assistant",
          "artifactPlan": {
            "recordingEnabled": false,
            "loggingEnabled": false,
            "transcriptPlan": { "enabled": false }
          }
        }
      },
      {
        "assistant": {
          "name": "Confirmation Assistant",
          "artifactPlan": {
            "recordingEnabled": true,
            "loggingEnabled": true,
            "transcriptPlan": { "enabled": true }
          }
        }
      }
    ]
  }
}
```

This flow ensures that:
- Service conversations are recorded for quality assurance
- Payment details (credit card numbers, CVV codes) are never recorded or logged
- Confirmation conversations are recorded for compliance

### Consent Gathering

For Enterprise customers, Vapi provides built-in [recording consent plans](/security-and-privacy/recording-consent-plan) that automatically create a consent assistant to request recording permission before transferring to your main assistant.

The Enterprise consent feature supports both:
- **Verbal consent**: Requires explicit "yes" confirmation from users
- **Implicit consent**: Assumes consent if users stay on the line after hearing the consent message

The system automatically tracks consent decisions and provides compliance data in the end-of-call report, including whether consent was granted and when it was obtained.

Alternatively, you can implement custom consent flows using squads:

```json
{
  "squad": {
    "members": [
      {
        "assistant": {
          "name": "Consent Assistant",
          "artifactPlan": {
            "recordingEnabled": false,
            "loggingEnabled": false,
            "transcriptPlan": { "enabled": false }
          }
        }
      },
      {
        "assistant": {
          "name": "Main Assistant", 
          "artifactPlan": {
            "recordingEnabled": true,
            "loggingEnabled": true,
            "transcriptPlan": { "enabled": true }
          }
        }
      }
    ]
  }
}
```

The consent assistant runs without generating artifacts, while the main assistant records the actual conversation after consent is obtained.

## Artifact Plan Configuration

### Basic Configuration

Configure recording, logging, and transcript generation using the `artifactPlan`:

<CodeBlocks>
```json title="Assistant Configuration"
{
  "name": "Customer Support Assistant",
  "artifactPlan": {
    "recordingEnabled": true,
    "recordingFormat": "wav;l16",
    "loggingEnabled": true,
    "pcapEnabled": true,
    "transcriptPlan": {
      "enabled": true,
      "assistantName": "Assistant",
      "userName": "Customer"
    }
  },
  "model": {
    "provider": "openai",
    "model": "gpt-4"
  },
  "voice": {
    "provider": "11labs",
    "voiceId": "harry"
  }
}
```

```json title="Per-Call Configuration"
{
  "assistant": {
    "name": "Support Agent",
    "artifactPlan": {
      "recordingEnabled": true,
      "recordingFormat": "wav;l16",
      "loggingEnabled": true,
      "pcapEnabled": true,
      "transcriptPlan": {
        "enabled": true,
        "assistantName": "Support Agent",
        "userName": "Customer"
      }
    }
  },
  "phoneNumberId": "your-phone-number-id"
}
```
</CodeBlocks>

### Artifact Plan Options

Configure different types of artifacts with these options:

- **`recordingEnabled`**: Enable call recording (stored in `call.artifact.recording`) Default: `true`
- **`recordingFormat`**: Audio format for recordings (e.g., "wav;l16", "mp3") Default: "wav;l16"
- **`loggingEnabled`**: Enable detailed call logs (stored in `call.artifact.logUrl`) Default: `true`
- **`pcapEnabled`**: Enable SIP packet capture for phone calls (stored in `call.artifact.pcapUrl`) Default: `true`
- **`transcriptPlan`**: Configure transcript generation with speaker names 

## Storage Configuration

### Default Storage

By default, Vapi stores artifacts securely in the cloud:

- Recordings, logs, and transcripts are encrypted at rest and in transit
- Access is controlled through your API credentials
- Artifacts are automatically cleaned up based on your retention policy

### Custom Storage

Configure custom storage for different artifact types:

<CodeBlocks>
```json title="S3 Storage Configuration"
{
  "artifactPlan": {
    "recordingEnabled": true,
    "recordingFormat": "wav;l16",
    "loggingEnabled": true,
    "pcapEnabled": true,
    "recordingUseCustomStorageEnabled": true,
    "loggingUseCustomStorageEnabled": true,
    "pcapUseCustomStorageEnabled": true,
    "recordingPath": "https://your-bucket.s3.amazonaws.com/recordings/",
    "loggingPath": "https://your-bucket.s3.amazonaws.com/logs/",
    "pcapS3PathPrefix": "/pcaps",
    "transcriptPlan": {
      "enabled": true,
      "assistantName": "Assistant",
      "userName": "Customer"
    }
  },
  "credentials": [
    {
      "provider": "aws",
      "region": "us-east-1",
      "accessKeyId": "your-access-key",
      "secretAccessKey": "your-secret-key"
    }
  ]
}
```

```json title="Google Cloud Storage"
{
  "artifactPlan": {
    "recordingEnabled": true,
    "recordingFormat": "wav;l16",
    "loggingEnabled": true,
    "pcapEnabled": true,
    "recordingUseCustomStorageEnabled": true,
    "loggingUseCustomStorageEnabled": true,
    "pcapUseCustomStorageEnabled": true,
    "recordingPath": "gs://your-bucket/recordings/",
    "loggingPath": "gs://your-bucket/logs/",
    "transcriptPlan": {
      "enabled": true,
      "assistantName": "Assistant",
      "userName": "Customer"
    }
  },
  "credentials": [
    {
      "provider": "gcp",
      "serviceAccountKey": "your-service-account-json"
    }
  ]
}
```
</CodeBlocks>

### Storage Control Options

Control where each artifact type is stored:

- **`recordingUseCustomStorageEnabled`**: Use custom storage for recordings (default: true)
- **`loggingUseCustomStorageEnabled`**: Use custom storage for logs (default: true)
- **`pcapUseCustomStorageEnabled`**: Use custom storage for SIP packet capture (default: true)
- **`recordingPath`**: Custom path for recording storage
- **`loggingPath`**: Custom path for log storage
- **`pcapS3PathPrefix`**: S3 path prefix for PCAP files

## Squad and Transfer Behavior

### Dynamic Artifact Control

When handing off between assistants in a Squad, you may choose to change the local context for each assistant via the `contextEngineeringPlan`. By default, only the final context will be used in the artifact and analysis (Structured outputs and success evaluation). To include the full message history across all assistants in the call, set [`artifactPlan.fullMessageHistoryEnabled`](/api-reference/squads/create#request.body.membersOverrides.artifactPlan.fullMessageHistoryEnabled) to true. 

In squads with multiple assistants, artifact generation (recording, logging, transcripts) can be controlled per assistant. When assistants are swapped or transferred during a call:

- **Recording**: Pauses when `recordingEnabled: false` assistant is active, resumes when `recordingEnabled: true` assistant takes over
- **Logging**: Pauses when `loggingEnabled: false` assistant is active, resumes when `loggingEnabled: true` assistant takes over  
- **Transcripts**: Pauses when `transcriptPlan.enabled: false` assistant is active, resumes when `transcriptPlan.enabled: true` assistant takes over

## Transcript Configuration

### Automatic Transcription

Configure transcript generation using the `transcriptPlan`:

```json
{
  "artifactPlan": {
    "transcriptPlan": {
      "enabled": true,
      "assistantName": "Assistant",
      "userName": "Customer"
    }
  }
}
```

### Transcript Plan Options

- **`enabled`**: Enable or disable transcript generation
- **`assistantName`**: Name to use for assistant messages in transcripts
- **`userName`**: Name to use for user messages in transcripts

### Transcript Features

- **Real-time transcription**: Transcripts are generated during the call
- **Speaker identification**: Distinguishes between assistant and user messages
- **Timestamps**: Each message includes timing information
- **OpenAI formatting**: Available in `call.artifact.messagesOpenAIFormatted`

### Transcript Structure

```json
{
  "callId": "call-123",
  "artifact": {
    "transcript": [
      {
        "role": "assistant",
        "message": "Hello! How can I help you today?",
        "time": 0.5
      },
      {
        "role": "user", 
        "message": "I need help with my account",
        "time": 3.2
      }
    ],
    "messagesOpenAIFormatted": [
      {
        "role": "assistant",
        "content": "Hello! How can I help you today?"
      },
      {
        "role": "user",
        "content": "I need help with my account"
      }
    ]
  }
}
```

## Logging Configuration

### Detailed Call Logs

Enable comprehensive logging for debugging and analysis:

```json
{
  "artifactPlan": {
    "loggingEnabled": true,
    "loggingUseCustomStorageEnabled": true,
    "loggingPath": "https://your-bucket.s3.amazonaws.com/logs/"
  }
}
```

### Log Features

- **Debug information**: Detailed logs for troubleshooting
- **Performance metrics**: Call timing and performance data
- **Error tracking**: Comprehensive error logs and stack traces
- **Workflow execution**: Step-by-step workflow node execution

### Accessing Logs

Logs are available through:
- **Dashboard**: View logs in the call details page
- **API**: Access via `call.artifact.logUrl`
- **Custom storage**: Store logs in your S3/GCP bucket

## Accessing Artifacts

### Via Dashboard

1. Navigate to **Calls** in your Vapi dashboard
2. Select a specific call from the list
3. View artifacts in the **Artifacts** section:
   - **Recording**: Play or download the audio recording
   - **Transcript**: View the full conversation transcript
   - **Logs**: Access detailed call logs for debugging
   - **PCAP**: Download SIP packet capture (phone calls only)

### Via API

Retrieve artifact URLs programmatically:

```typescript
import { VapiClient } from "@vapi-ai/server-sdk";

const client = new VapiClient({ token: "your-api-key" });

// Get call details including all artifacts
const call = await client.calls.get("call-id");

console.log("Recording URL:", call.artifact.recording);
console.log("Transcript:", call.artifact.transcript);
console.log("Log URL:", call.artifact.logUrl);
console.log("PCAP URL:", call.artifact.pcapUrl);
console.log("Messages:", call.artifact.messages);
console.log("Nodes:", call.artifact.nodes);
```

## Privacy and Compliance

### Legal Considerations

**Important**: Call recording laws vary by jurisdiction. Ensure compliance with:

- **Consent requirements** - Inform participants about recording
- **Data protection** regulations (GDPR, CCPA, etc.)
- **Industry standards** (PCI DSS, HIPAA, etc.)

### Built-in Consent Management

For Enterprise customers, Vapi provides automated consent management through [recording consent plans](/security-and-privacy/recording-consent-plan). This feature automatically:

- Creates a consent assistant that requests recording permission
- Handles both verbal and stay-on-line consent types
- Only begins recording after consent is granted
- Maintains audit trails of consent decisions

### Best Practices

- **Inform callers** about recording at the start of conversations
- **Secure storage** with encryption and access controls
- **Retention policies** to automatically delete old recordings
- **Access logs** to track who accesses recordings

<Warning>
  Always comply with local laws regarding call recording. Some jurisdictions require explicit consent from all parties before recording.
</Warning>

## Recording Analysis

### Call Artifacts

Use the comprehensive artifact data for analysis:

```json
{
  "callId": "call-123",
  "artifact": {
    "recording": "https://api.vapi.ai/recordings/call-123.mp3",
    "transcript": [
      {
        "role": "assistant",
        "message": "Hello! How can I help you today?",
        "time": 0.5
      },
      {
        "role": "user", 
        "message": "I need help with my account",
        "time": 3.2
      }
    ],
    "logUrl": "https://api.vapi.ai/logs/call-123.json",
    "messages": [
      {
        "role": "assistant",
        "message": "Hello! How can I help you today?"
      },
      {
        "role": "user",
        "message": "I need help with my account"
      }
    ],
    "nodes": [
      {
        "name": "greeting",
        "messages": ["Hello! How can I help you today?"],
        "variables": {}
      }
    ],
    "variableValues": {
      "customerName": "John Doe",
      "issueType": "account_access"
    }
  }

The Call Recording feature allows you to capture and store full recordings of phone calls for analysis. By default, Vapi stores a complete recording of every call, providing both mono and stereo audio. The stereo option separates human and assistant audio into two distinct channels, offering a clearer analysis of the conversation.

You can customize this behavior in the assistant's [`assistant.artifactPlan`](/api-reference/assistants/create#request.body.artifactPlan).

## Recording Formats

Vapi supports multiple recording formats to fit your storage and playback needs.

You can specify your preferred format using the [`assistant.artifactPlan.recordingFormat`](/api-reference/assistants/create#request.body.artifactPlan.recordingFormat) property. If not specified, recordings will default to `wav;l16`.

**Supported formats:**
- `wav;l16` (default) - High quality linear PCM
- `mp3` - Compressed format for smaller file sizes  
- `flac` - Lossless compression for archival

## Storage Options

Vapi supports uploading recordings to your own storage buckets. See [Integrations -> Cloud](/providers/cloud/s3) for more information on available storage options.

**Supported cloud storage providers:**
- AWS S3
- Google Cloud Storage  
- Cloudflare R2
- Supabase

## Configuration Options

### Enable/Disable Recording

You can turn on/off call recording by setting the [`assistant.artifactPlan.recordingEnabled`](/api-reference/assistants/create#request.body.artifactPlan.recordingEnabled) property to `true` or `false`. If not specified, recordings will default to `true`.

**HIPAA Compliance:** If [HIPAA](/security-and-privacy/hipaa) mode is enabled, Vapi will only store recordings if you have defined a custom storage bucket. Make sure to set credentials in the Provider Credentials section of your dashboard.

### Video Recording

You can turn on/off video recording by setting the [`assistant.artifactPlan.videoRecordingEnabled`](/api-reference/assistants/create#request.body.artifactPlan.videoRecordingEnabled) property to `true` or `false`. If not specified, video recording will default to `false`.

## Upload Path

When uploading recordings to your custom storage bucket, you can specify the upload path using the `assistant.artifactPlan.recordingPath` property. If not specified, recordings will default to the root of the bucket.

Usage:
- If you want to upload the recording to a specific path, set this to the path. Example: `/my-assistant-recordings`.
- If you want to upload the recording to the root of the bucket, set this to `/`.

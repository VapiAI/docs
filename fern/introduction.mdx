Vapi lets developers build, test, & deploy voice AI agents in minutes rather than months — solving for the foundational challenges voice AI applications face:

  <Card

    Turn-taking, interruption handling, backchanneling, and more.
  </Card>
  <Card title="Realtime/Low Latency Demands" icon="timer" iconType="regular" color="#f25130">
    Responsive conversation demands low latency. Internationally. (\<500-800ms voice-to-voice).
  </Card>
  <Card title="Taking Actions (Function Calling)" icon="function" iconType="regular">
    Taking actions during conversation, getting data to your services for custom actions.
  </Card>
  <Card title="Extracting Conversation Data" icon="waves-sine" iconType="regular" color="#CC42F9">

  </Card>
</CardGroup>

<Info>
  Implemented from scratch, this functionality can take months to build, and
  large, continuous, resources to maintain & improve.

Vapi abstracts away these complexities, allowing developers to focus on the core of their voice AI application's business logic. **Shipping in days, not months.**

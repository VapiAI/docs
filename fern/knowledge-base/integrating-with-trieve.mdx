# Using Trieve with Vapi

Vapi offers two ways to integrate with [Trieve](https://trieve.ai):

1. **Direct Integration**: Create and manage Trieve datasets directly through Vapi
2. **BYOK (Bring Your Own Key)**: Use your Trieve API key to import your existing Trieve datasets into Vapi

## Direct Integration with Trieve

When using Trieve directly through Vapi, you can create and manage datasets, but they'll be tied to Vapi's account. This approach offers:

- Quick setup with minimal configuration
- Basic dataset management through Vapi's API
- Limited customization options

### Setting up Direct Integration

1. Navigate to the [Vapi dashboard credentials page](https://dashboard.vapi.ai/keys)
2. Add your Trieve API key from [Trieve's dashboard](https://dashboard.trieve.ai/org/keys)
3. Create a new knowledge base with Trieve as the provider:

```json
{
  "name": "my-trieve-kb",
  "provider": "trieve",
  "searchPlan": {
    "scoreThreshold": 0.2,
    "searchType": "semantic"
  },
  "createPlan": {
    "type": "create",
    "chunkPlans": [
      {
        "fileIds": ["file-123", "file-456"],
        "websites": ["https://example.com"],
        "targetSplitsPerChunk": 50,
        "rebalanceChunks": true
      }
    ]
  }
}
```

## BYOK with Trieve (Recommended)

The BYOK approach offers more flexibility and control over your datasets. You can:

- Fully manage your datasets in Trieve's native interface
- Use Trieve's advanced features like:
  - Custom chunking rules
  - Search playground testing
  - Manual chunk editing
  - Website crawling
  - Dataset visualization

### Step 1: Set Up Trieve Dataset

  - Location: Set or modify geographical coordinates
  - Weight: Fine-tune search relevance with custom weights
  - Fulltext Boost: Add terms to enhance search visibility
  - Semantic Boost: Adjust vector embedding influence

##### Best Practices for Chunk Editing

1. **Content Length**

   - Keep chunks between 200-1000 tokens
   - Maintain logical content boundaries
   - Ensure complete thoughts within each chunk

2. **Metadata Optimization**

   - Use consistent date formats
   - Add relevant numeric values for filtering
   - Apply weights strategically for important content

3. **Search Enhancement**
   - Use boost terms for critical keywords
   - Balance semantic and fulltext boosts
   - Test search results after significant edits

### Advanced Chunking Options

#### Metadata

- Add custom metadata as JSON to associate with your chunks
  - Useful for filtering and organizing content (e.g., `{"author": "John Doe", "category": "technical"}`)
  - Keep metadata concise and relevant to avoid storage overhead
  - Use consistent keys across related documents for better searchability

#### Date

- Specify the creation or relevant date for the document
  - Important for version control and content freshness
  - Helps with filtering outdated information
  - Use actual document creation dates when possible

#### Split Delimiters

- Define custom delimiters (e.g., ".,?\n") to control where chunks are split
  - Recommended defaults: ".,?\n" for general content
  - Add semicolons (;) for technical documentation
  - Use "\n\n" for markdown or structured content
  - Avoid over-aggressive splitting that might break context

#### Target Splits Per Chunk

- Set the desired number of splits per chunk
  - Default: 20 splits
  - Recommended ranges:
    - 15-25 for general content
    - 10-15 for technical documentation
    - 25-30 for narrative content
  - Lower values create more granular chunks, better for precise retrieval
  - Higher values maintain more context but may retrieve irrelevant information

#### Rebalance Chunks

- Enable to redistribute content evenly across chunks
  - Recommended for documents with varying section lengths
  - Helps maintain consistent chunk sizes
  - May slightly impact natural content boundaries
  - Best used with technical documentation or structured content

#### Use gpt4o chunking

- Enable GPT-4 optimized chunking for improved semantic coherence
  - Recommended for:
    - Complex technical documentation
    - Content with intricate relationships
    - Documents where context preservation is crucial
  - Note: Increases processing time and cost
  - Best for high-value content where accuracy is paramount

#### Heading Based Chunking

- Split content based on document headings
  - Ideal for well-structured documents (e.g., documentation, reports)
  - Works best with consistent heading hierarchy
  - Consider enabling for:
    - Technical documentation
    - User manuals
    - Research papers
  - May create uneven chunk sizes based on section lengths

#### System Prompt

- Provide custom instructions for the chunking process
  - Optional but powerful for specific use cases
  - Example prompts:
    - "Preserve code blocks as single chunks"
    - "Keep API endpoint descriptions together"
    - "Maintain question-answer pairs in the same chunk"
  - Keep prompts clear and specific
  - Test different prompts with sample content to optimize results

### Step 3: Import to Vapi

1. Create your Trieve API key from [Trieve's dashboard](https://dashboard.trieve.ai/org/keys)
2. Add your Trieve API key to Vapi [Provider Credentials](https://dashboard.vapi.ai/keys)
  ![Add Trieve API key in Vapi](../static/images/knowledge-base/trieve-credential.png)
3. Once your dataset is optimized in Trieve, import it to Vapi:

```json
{
  "name": "trieve-byok",
  "provider": "trieve",
  "searchPlan": {
    "scoreThreshold": 0.2,
    "searchType": "semantic"
  },
  "createPlan": {
    "type": "import",
    "providerId": "<Your Trieve Dataset ID>"
  }
}
```

## Best Practices

1. **Dataset Organization**

   - Segment datasets by domain knowledge boundaries
   - Use semantic-based dataset naming (e.g., "api-docs-v2", "user-guides-2024")
   - Version control chunking configurations in your codebase

2. **Content Quality**

   - Implement text normalization (Unicode normalization, whitespace standardization)
   - Use regex patterns to clean formatting artifacts
   - Validate chunk semantic coherence through embedding similarity scores

3. **Performance Optimization**

   - Target chunk sizes: 200-1000 tokens (optimal for current embedding models)
   - Configure hybrid search with BM25 boost = 0.3 for technical content
   - Set score thresholds dynamically based on embedding model (0.2 for text-embedding-3-small, 0.25 for text-embedding-3-large)

4. **Maintenance**
   - Implement automated content refresh cycles via Trieve's API
   - Track search result relevance metrics (MRR, NDCG)
   - Rotate API keys on 90-day cycles

## Troubleshooting

Common issues and solutions:

1. **Search Relevance Issues**

   - Implement cross-encoder reranking for critical queries
   - Fine-tune BM25 vs semantic weights (recommended ratio: 0.3:0.7)
   - Analyze chunk boundary overlap percentage (aim for 15-20%)

2. **Integration Errors**

   - Validate dataset permissions (READ_DATASET scope required)
   - Check for dataset ID format compliance (UUID v4)
   - Monitor rate limits (default: 100 requests/min)

3. **Performance Optimization**
   - Implement chunk size normalization (max variance: 20%)
   - Enable query caching for frequent searches
   - Use batch operations for bulk updates (max 100 chunks/request)

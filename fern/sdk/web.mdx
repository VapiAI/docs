## Usage

### `.start()`

You can start a web call by calling the `.start()` function. The `start` function can either accept:

1. **a string**, representing an assistant ID
2. **an object**, representing a set of assistant configs (see [Create Assistant](/api-reference/assistants/create-assistant))

The `start` function returns a promise that resolves to a call object. For example:

```javascript
const call = await vapi.start(assistantId);
// { "id": "bd2184a1-bdea-4d4f-9503-b09ca8b185e6", "orgId": "6da6841c-0fca-4604-8941-3d5d65f43a17", "createdAt": "2024-11-13T19:20:24.606Z", "updatedAt": "2024-11-13T19:20:24.606Z", "type": "webCall", ... }
```

#### Passing an Assistant ID

If you already have an assistant that you created (either via [the Dashboard](/quickstart/dashboard) or [the API](/api-reference/assistants/create-assistant)), you can start the call with the assistant's ID:

```javascript
vapi.start("79f3XXXX-XXXX-XXXX-XXXX-XXXXXXXXce48");
```

#### Passing Assistant Configuration Inline

You can also specify configuration for your assistant inline.

This will not create a [persistent assistant](/assistants/persistent-assistants) that is saved to your account, rather it will create an ephemeral assistant only used for this call specifically.

You can pass the assistant's configuration in an object (see [Create Assistant](/api-reference/assistants/create-assistant) for a list of acceptable fields):

```javascript
vapi.start({
  transcriber: {
    provider: "deepgram",
    model: "nova-2",
    language: "en-US",
  },
  model: {
    provider: "openai",
    model: "gpt-3.5-turbo",
    messages: [
      {
        role: "system",
        content: "You are a helpful assistant.",
      },
    ],
  },
  voice: {
    provider: "playht",
    voiceId: "jennifer",
  },
  name: "My Inline Assistant",
  ...
});
```

#### Overriding Assistant Configurations

To override assistant settings or set template variables, you can pass `assistantOverrides` as the second argument.

For example, if the first message is "Hello `{{name}}`", set `assistantOverrides` to the following to replace `{{name}}` with `John`:

```javascript
const assistantOverrides = {
  transcriber: {
    provider: "deepgram",
    model: "nova-2",
    language: "en-US",
  },
  recordingEnabled: false,
  variableValues: {
    name: "Alice",
  },
};

vapi.start("79f3XXXX-XXXX-XXXX-XXXX-XXXXXXXXce48", assistantOverrides);
```

### `.send()`

During the call, you can send intermediate messages to the assistant (like [background messages](/assistants/background-messages)).

- `type` will always be `"add-message"`
- the `message` field will have 2 items, `role` and `content`.

```javascript
vapi.send({
  type: "add-message",
  message: {
    role: "system",
    content: "The user has pressed the button, say peanuts",
  },
});
```

<Info>
  Possible values for role are `system`, `user`, `assistant`, `tool` or
  `function`.
</Info>

### `.stop()`

You can stop the call session by calling the `stop` method:

```javascript
vapi.stop();
```

This will stop the recording and close the connection.

### `.isMuted()`

Check if the user's microphone is muted:

```javascript
vapi.isMuted();
```

### `.setMuted(muted: boolean)`

You can mute & unmute the user's microphone with `setMuted`:

```javascript
vapi.isMuted(); // false
vapi.setMuted(true);
vapi.isMuted(); // true
```

### `say(message: string, endCallAfterSpoken?: boolean)`

The `say` method can be used to invoke speech and gracefully terminate the call if needed

```javascript
vapi.say("Our time's up, goodbye!", true)
```

## Events

You can listen on the `vapi` instance for events. These events allow you to react to changes in the state of the call or user speech.

#### `speech-start`

Occurs when your AI assistant has started speaking.

```javascript
vapi.on("speech-start", () => {
  console.log("Assistant speech has started.");
});
```

#### `speech-end`

Occurs when your AI assistant has finished speaking.

```javascript
vapi.on("speech-end", () => {
  console.log("Assistant speech has ended.");
});
```

#### `call-start`

Occurs when the call has connected & begins.

```javascript
vapi.on("call-start", () => {
  console.log("Call has started.");
});
```

#### `call-end`

Occurs when the call has disconnected & ended.

```javascript
vapi.on("call-end", () => {
  console.log("Call has ended.");
});
```

#### `volume-level`

Realtime volume level updates for the assistant. A floating-point number between `0` & `1`.

```javascript
vapi.on("volume-level", (volume) => {
  console.log(`Assistant volume level: ${volume}`);
});
```

#### `message`

Various assistant messages can be sent back to the client during the call. These are the same messages that your [server](/server-url) would receive.

At [assistant creation time](/api-reference/assistants/create-assistant), you can specify on the `clientMessages` field the set of messages you'd like the assistant to send back to the client.

Those messages will come back via the `message` event:

```javascript
// Various assistant messages can come back (like function calls, transcripts, etc)
vapi.on("message", (message) => {
  console.log(message);
});
```

#### `error`

Handle errors that occur during the call.

```javascript
vapi.on("error", (e) => {
  console.error(e);
});
```

description: Build a simple agent that greets users and gathers basic information using Vapi workflows.
---

## Overview

Build a simple voice agent using Vapi's visual workflow builder that greets users, collects their information, and demonstrates core workflow concepts like variable extraction, conditional routing, and global nodes.

<Frame>
  <img src="../static/images/workflows/workflows-quickstart-flow.png" alt="Vapi Workflows" />
</Frame>

**Agent Capabilities:**
* Greet users and ask about their voice agent needs
* Extract and store user information (name and city)
* Use variables in dynamic responses
* Handle escalation to human agents at any point

**What You'll Build:**
* Multi-node conversation flow with branching logic
* Variable extraction and liquid template usage
* Global escalation nodes for human transfer
* End-call automation with natural conversation termination

## Prerequisites

* A [Vapi account](https://dashboard.vapi.ai)
* For SDK usage: API key from the Dashboard

## Scenario

We will create a simple information-gathering workflow that demonstrates the core features of Vapi's workflow builder. This workflow will showcase conversation flow, variable extraction, and escalation patterns that form the foundation of more complex workflows.

<Note>
**Workflows vs Assistants**: Workflows are visual conversation flows with branching logic and variable extraction. Assistants are single AI agents with tools and continuous conversation. This guide covers workflows specifically.

## 4. Add Dynamic Response Node

      <Step title="Add a third conversation node">
        Add another **Conversation Node** with this prompt:

        ```txt
        Say "Thanks {{first_name}}, {{city}} is great!"

        Then say a few nice words about the {{city}}. Keep it brief. After that, ask the user if there's anything you can help with and help them, unless they no longer need help.
        ```
      </Step>
      <Step title="Remove the edge condition">
        Click on the edge leading to this node and:
        - Remove any condition text (leave it blank)
        - Click **Save**
        
        This allows automatic flow after the variables are extracted.

## 7. Test Your Workflow

  <Tab title="Dashboard">
    <Steps>
      <Step title="Test the complete flow">
        Click **Call** in the top right to test your workflow:
        - Verify the greeting works
        - Test variable extraction by providing your name and city
        - Confirm the dynamic response uses your information
        - Test the global escalation by saying "I want to speak to a human"
      </Step>
      <Step title="Review your workflow structure">
        Your final workflow should have:
        - **Start Node**: Greeting and use case inquiry
        - **Collection Node**: Information gathering with variable extraction
        - **Response Node**: Dynamic response using extracted variables
        - **Global Node**: Human escalation available from anywhere
        - **Transfer Node**: Routes to human agent when needed
        - **End Node**: Natural conversation termination

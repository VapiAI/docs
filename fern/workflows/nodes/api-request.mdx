## Overview

The **API Request** enables your workflow to interact with external APIs. It supports both GET and POST methods, allowing the integration of external data and services.

## Configuration

- **URL:** Enter the endpoint to request.
- **Method:** Specify the HTTP method (GET or POST).
- **Headers:** Define each header with a key, value, and type.
- **Body Values:** For POST requests, provide key, value, and type for each entry.
- **Output Values:** Extract data from the API's JSON response:
  - **Key:** The key within the JSON payload to extract.
  - **Target:** The name of the output variable for the extracted value.
  - **Type:** The data type of the extracted value.
- **Mode:** Toggle asynchronous execution with "run in the background" on or off.

## Usage

Use the API Request to fetch information from an external API to use in your workflow, or to update information in your CRM or database.

1. **HTTP Configuration**: Enter the URL you want the workflow to call and select the HTTP method.
2. **API Metadata**: Specify key-value pairs for Headers and Body (for POST requests). This allows you to include authentication tokens and payload data with your API request.
3. **Define Output**: Set the expected output schema for the API response. This schema is used to extract variables that can be utilized later in your workflow.

For example, if the expected API response is
```jsx
{
    "name": "Jaden Dearsley",
    "age": 25,
    "isActive": true,
}
```

Define an output JSON schema for the API request with
```jsx
{
  ...
  "output": {
    "type": "object",
    "properties": {
      "name": {
        "type": "string",
        "description": "name of the user",
      },
      "age": {
        "type": "number",
        "description": "age of the user",
      },
      "isActive": {
        "type": "boolean",
        "description": "whether the user is active",
      }
    }
  },
}
```

This will make `name`, `age`, and `isActive` available as variables for use throughout the rest of the workflow. To rename a variable, use the `target` option to specify a different variable name.

```jsx
{
  ...
  "output": {
    "type": "object",
    "properties": {
      "name": {
        "type": "string",
        "description": "name of the user",
        "target": "user_name" // renamed "name" to "user_name"
      },
      ...
    }
  },
}
```

If your expected output has a complex or nested structure, we support the full JSON schema through the API. Refer to the API documentation on [`output`](api-reference/workflow/workflow-controller-create#request.body.nodes.apiRequest.output) for more details.

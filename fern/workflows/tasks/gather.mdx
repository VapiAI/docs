## Overview

The **Gather** task collects input from users during an interaction. It is used to capture variables that will be referenced later in your workflow.

## Configuration

Define one or more variables to gather from the user with:
- **Name:** A unique identifier.
- **Description:** Details about the expected input to help the LLM get the right information from the caller.
- **Data Type:** String, number, or boolean.
- **Required:** Mark whether the variable is required or optional.

## Usage

Use the Gather task when you need to prompt users for information—such as their name, email, or ZIP code—that will drive subsequent conversation steps.

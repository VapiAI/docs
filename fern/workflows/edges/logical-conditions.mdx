## Overview

Logical Conditions enable you to create branching paths within your workflow. This feature allows your voice agent to decide the next steps based on data gathered earlier or retrieved via API calls.

## Configuration

- **Condition Node:** Start by inserting a condition node into your workflow.
- **Branch Setup:** Attach one or more nodes to the condition node.
- **Logic Tag:** Click the "Logic" tag on each connecting edge to define rules or comparisons (e.g., equals, greater than) using variables collected from previous steps.

## Usage

Implement Logical Conditions to guide your conversation dynamically. They allow your workflow to adjust its path based on real-time data, ensuring more personalized and responsive interactions.

For detailed configuration instructions and advanced usage, please refer to our dedicated documentation on condition configuration.

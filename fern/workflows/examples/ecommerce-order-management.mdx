## 1. Create a Knowledge Base

<Steps>
  <Step title="Download the spreadsheets">
    <div className="flex gap-2">
      <Download src="../../static/spreadsheets/ecommerce/customers.csv">
        <Button intent="primary">Download customers.csv</Button>
      </Download>
      <Download src="../../static/spreadsheets/ecommerce/orders.csv">
        <Button intent="primary">Download orders.csv</Button>
      </Download>
      <Download src="../../static/spreadsheets/ecommerce/products.csv">
        <Button intent="primary">Download products.csv</Button>
      </Download>
      <Download src="../../static/spreadsheets/ecommerce/returns.csv">
        <Button intent="primary">Download returns.csv</Button>
      </Download>
    </div>
  </Step>
  <Step title="Navigate to the Files section">
    In your Vapi dashboard, click `Files` in the left sidebar.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Upload the spreadsheets">
    - Click `Choose file`. Upload all four CSV files: `customers.csv`, `orders.csv`, `products.csv`, and `returns.csv`.
    - Note the file IDs. We'll need them later to create tools.

## 4. Build the Workflow

You'll start with a default template that includes a "Call Start" node. We'll modify the existing nodes and add new ones to create our e-commerce customer service workflow.

<Steps>
  <Step title="Configure the Initial Conversation Node">
    The default template includes a conversation node. Click on it and configure:
    
    **Node Name**: `greeting_and_inquiry_type`
    
    **Prompt**:
    ```txt
    You are Emma, the friendly customer service representative for TechGear Online.

    Start with: "Hello! Thank you for calling TechGear Online customer service. This is Emma, your virtual assistant. I can help you track orders, process returns, answer product questions, or resolve any issues. How can I assist you today?"

    Listen to the customer's response and determine their inquiry type:
    - "order_tracking" for checking order status or shipping
    - "return_exchange" for returns, exchanges, or refunds
    - "product_inquiry" for product questions or recommendations
    - "billing_payment" for payment or billing issues
    - "complaint" for problems or complaints
    - "general" for other inquiries

    Keep responses friendly and under 35 words.
    ```

    **Extract Variables**:
    - Variable: `inquiry_type`
    - Type: `String`
    - Description: `The customer's inquiry type`
    - Enum Values: `order_tracking`, `return_exchange`, `product_inquiry`, `billing_payment`, `complaint`, `general`
  </Step>

  <Step title="Add Customer Identification Node">
    Add a **Conversation** node:
    
    **Node Name**: `customer_identification`
    
    **Prompt**:
    ```txt
    I'll be happy to help you with that. To look up your account, can you please provide your phone number or email address associated with your TechGear Online account?

    If you don't have an account, that's okay - I can still help you with general product questions.
    ```

    **Variable Extraction**:
    - Variable: `customer_phone`
    - Type: `string`
    - Description: `Customer's phone number`
    - Required: `false`
    - Variable: `customer_email`
    - Type: `string`
    - Description: `Customer's email address`
    - Required: `false`
  </Step>

  <Step title="Add Customer Lookup Tool Node">
    Add a **Tool** node:
    
    **Tool**: Select your pre-configured "Customer Lookup" tool from the dropdown. This tool should be created in the **Tools** section of your dashboard with:
    - **Function Name**: `lookup_customer`
    - **Description**: "Look up customer account and order history"
    - **Parameters**: 
      - `customer_id` (string): Customer ID to lookup
    - **Server URL**: `https://jsonplaceholder.typicode.com/users`
  </Step>

  <Step title="Add Inquiry-Based Routing">
    Create branching paths based on the customer's inquiry type. Add multiple conversation nodes:

    **Order Tracking Node**:
    - **Node Name**: `order_tracking_flow`
    - **Prompt**: `I can help you track your order. Do you have your order number, or would you like me to look up your recent orders?`

    **Return/Exchange Node**:
    - **Node Name**: `return_exchange_flow`
    - **Prompt**: `I can help you with returns and exchanges. Can you tell me which item you'd like to return and the reason for the return?`

    **Product Inquiry Node**:
    - **Node Name**: `product_inquiry_flow`
    - **Prompt**: `I'd be happy to help with product information. What specific product are you interested in, or what type of device are you looking for?`

    **Billing/Payment Node**:
    - **Node Name**: `billing_payment_flow`
    - **Prompt**: `I can help with billing and payment questions. Are you looking to update payment information, dispute a charge, or have questions about a specific order?`

    **Complaint Resolution Node**:
    - **Node Name**: `complaint_resolution_flow`
    - **Prompt**: `I'm sorry to hear you're having an issue. I want to make this right for you. Can you tell me what happened so I can help resolve this?`
  </Step>

  <Step title="Configure Flow Conditions">
    Connect the nodes with conditions for the LLM to interpret:

    **From greeting_and_inquiry_type to order_tracking_flow**:
    - Condition: `{{ inquiry_type == "order_tracking" }}`

    **From greeting_and_inquiry_type to return_exchange_flow**:
    - Condition: `{{ inquiry_type == "return_exchange" }}`

    **From greeting_and_inquiry_type to product_inquiry_flow**:
    - Condition: `{{ inquiry_type == "product_inquiry" }}`

    **From greeting_and_inquiry_type to billing_payment_flow**:
    - Condition: `{{ inquiry_type == "billing_payment" }}`

    **From greeting_and_inquiry_type to complaint_resolution_flow**:
    - Condition: `{{ inquiry_type == "complaint" }}`
  </Step>

  <Step title="Add Global VIP Customer Handler">
    Create a global node that provides special handling for VIP customers:
    
    **Node Name**: `vip_customer_handler`
    **Global Node**: `enabled = true`
    **Enter Condition**: `{{ customer_tier == "VIP" or total_orders > 50 or lifetime_value > 5000 }}`
    
    **Prompt**:
    ```txt
    I see you're one of our valued VIP customers. I want to make sure you receive our highest level of service today. Let me prioritize your request and see what I can do to exceed your expectations.
    ```
    
    This global node will activate for high-value customers, regardless of their inquiry type.
  </Step>

  <Step title="Add Order Tracking Flow">
    For the order tracking path, add these nodes:

    **Order Number Collection Node**:
    - **Node Name**: `collect_order_number`
    - Extract order number or use recent orders from customer history

    **Order Status Tool Node**:
    - Add a **Tool** node that calls your order tracking API with order information

    **Shipping Information Node**:
    - **Node Name**: `provide_shipping_info`
    - Present tracking details, delivery estimates, and shipping updates
  </Step>

  <Step title="Add Return Processing Flow">
    **Return Eligibility Check Node**:
    - **Node Name**: `check_return_eligibility`
    - Verify return policy compliance and item condition

    **Return Authorization Tool Node**:
    - Add a **Tool** node that creates return label and authorization number

    **Refund Processing Node**:

    - Use when customer issue is resolved

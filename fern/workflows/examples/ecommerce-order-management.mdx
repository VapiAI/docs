* Global fraud detection and sentiment monitoring

## Prerequisites

* A [Vapi account](https://dashboard.vapi.ai/).

* Shipping carrier integrations.

## Scenario

We will be creating an order management workflow for TechGear Online, an electronics retailer that wants to automate customer service calls and improve order resolution times through sophisticated workflow automation.

  <Step title="Navigate to the Files section">
    In your Vapi dashboard, click `Files` in the left sidebar.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Upload the spreadsheets">
    - Click `Choose file`. Upload all four CSV files: `customers.csv`, `orders.csv`, `products.csv`, and `returns.csv`.
    - Note the file IDs. We'll need them later to create tools.

## 4. Build the Workflow

You'll start with a default template that includes a "Call Start" node. We'll modify the existing nodes and add new ones to create our e-commerce customer service workflow.

<Steps>
  <Step title="Configure the Initial Conversation Node">
    The default template includes a conversation node. Click on it and configure:
    
    **Node Name**: `greeting_and_inquiry_type`
    
    ```txt title="First Message"
    Hello! Thank you for calling TechGear Online customer service. This is Emma, your virtual assistant. I can help you track orders, process returns, answer product questions, or resolve any issues. How can I assist you today?
    ```
    
    ```txt title="Prompt"
    You are Emma, the friendly customer service representative for TechGear Online.

    Listen to the customer's response and determine their inquiry type:
    - "order_tracking" for checking order status or shipping
    - "return_exchange" for returns, exchanges, or refunds
    - "product_inquiry" for product questions or recommendations
    - "billing_payment" for payment or billing issues
    - "complaint" for problems or complaints
    - "general" for other inquiries

    Keep responses friendly and under 35 words. Be helpful and professional.
    ```

    **Extract Variables**:
    - Variable: `inquiry_type`
    - Type: `String`

    ```txt title="First Message"
    I'll be happy to help you with that. To look up your account, can you please provide your phone number or email address associated with your TechGear Online account?
    ```
    
    ```txt title="Prompt"
    You are collecting customer information to look up their account.

    If you don't have an account, that's okay - I can still help you with general product questions.
    Be patient and helpful. Extract phone number or email clearly.
    Keep responses under 25 words.
    ```

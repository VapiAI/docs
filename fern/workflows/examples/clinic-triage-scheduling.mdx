description: Build a voice AI clinic workflow with medical triage protocols, appointment booking, and emergency routing using Vapi's visual workflow builder.
---

## Overview

Build an AI-powered clinic receptionist workflow that handles patient triage, appointment scheduling, and emergency routing using Vapi workflows with medical protocol compliance and safety monitoring.

**What You'll Build:**
* Medical triage assessment with symptom-based routing
* Emergency detection with global safety protocols
* Provider scheduling with urgency prioritization
* Prescription refill processing with safety checks

## Prerequisites

* A [Vapi account](https://dashboard.vapi.ai/).
* Medical triage protocols and guidelines.
* Healthcare provider scheduling system.

## Scenario

We will be creating a triage and scheduling workflow for Riverside Family Clinic, a primary care practice that wants to improve patient access while ensuring appropriate care routing and emergency response through sophisticated workflow automation.

## Final Workflow

      <Step title="Navigate to the Files section">
        In your Vapi dashboard, click `Files` in the left sidebar.
      </Step>
      <Step title="Upload the spreadsheets">
        - Click `Choose file`. Upload all four CSV files: `patients.csv`, `providers.csv`, `triage_protocols.csv`, and `appointments.csv`.
        - Note the file IDs. We'll need them later to create tools.

## 4. Build the Workflow

You'll start with a default template that includes a "Call Start" node. We'll modify the existing nodes and add new ones to create our medical triage and scheduling workflow.

<Steps>
  <Step title="Configure the Initial Conversation Node">
    The default template includes a conversation node. Click on it and configure:
    
    ```txt title="First Message"
    Thank you for calling Riverside Family Clinic. This is your virtual assistant. I can help you schedule appointments, address medical concerns, or direct you to emergency care. How can I help you today?
    ```
    
    ```txt title="Prompt"
    You are a professional medical assistant for Riverside Family Clinic.

    Listen carefully to determine the caller's purpose:
    - "emergency" for life-threatening situations
    - "medical_triage" for symptom assessment
    - "appointment" for scheduling needs
    - "prescription" for refill requests
    - "general" for other inquiries

    Always prioritize patient safety and follow medical protocols. Keep responses under 35 words.
    ```

    **Extract Variables**:
    - Variable: `call_purpose`
    - Type: `String`
    - Description: `Primary purpose of the patient's call`
    - Enum Values: `emergency`, `medical_triage`, `appointment`, `prescription`, `general`
  </Step>

  <Step title="Add Patient Verification Node">
    Click the + button below the greeting node and add a new **Conversation** node:
    
    ```txt title="Condition"
    Call purpose identified
    ```

    ```txt title="First Message"
    I'll need to verify your information first. Please provide your patient ID, date of birth, or full name so I can access your medical record.
    ```
    
    ```txt title="Prompt"
    You are collecting patient identification for medical record access.

    Get patient ID, date of birth, or full name for verification.
    Be professional and reassuring about medical privacy.
    Follow HIPAA protocols. Keep responses under 25 words.
    ```

    **Extract Variables**:
    - Variable: `patient_id`
    - Type: `String` 
    - Description: `Patient's ID number if provided`
    <br />
    - Variable: `patient_name`
    - Type: `String`
    - Description: `Patient's full name if provided`
    <br />
    - Variable: `date_of_birth`
    - Type: `String`
    - Description: `Patient's date of birth if provided`
  </Step>

  <Step title="Add Patient Lookup Tool Node">
    Add a **Tool** node:
    
    ```txt title="Condition"
    Patient information collected
    ```
    
    **Select Tool**: Choose your pre-configured patient lookup tool from the dropdown. This tool will use the extracted patient information to find their medical record.
  </Step>

  <Step title="Add Call Purpose Routing Logic">
    Create branching paths based on the patient's call purpose. Add multiple conversation nodes:

    **Emergency Routing Node**:
    
    ```txt title="Condition"
    Patient verified and purpose is emergency
    ```
    
    ```txt title="First Message"
    I understand this is an emergency. For immediate life-threatening situations, please hang up and call 911 now. For urgent medical needs, I'm connecting you to our triage nurse immediately.
    ```
    
    ```txt title="Prompt"
    You are handling a medical emergency call.
    
    Direct to 911 for life-threatening emergencies.
    Transfer to triage nurse for urgent medical situations.
    Be calm, clear, and immediate in your response.
    ```

    **Medical Triage Node**:
    
    ```txt title="Condition"
    Patient verified and purpose is medical_triage
    ```
    
    ```txt title="First Message"
    I'll help assess your medical concerns. Please describe your main symptoms, when they started, and how severe they are on a scale of 1 to 10.
    ```
    
    ```txt title="Prompt"
    You are conducting initial medical triage assessment.
    
    Collect symptoms, onset time, severity, and related factors.
    Follow medical assessment protocols. Be thorough but efficient.
    Keep responses under 30 words.
    ```

    **Appointment Scheduling Node**:
    
    ```txt title="Condition"
    Patient verified and purpose is appointment
    ```
    
    ```txt title="First Message"
    I'll help you schedule an appointment. What type of visit do you need - routine check-up, follow-up, or consultation for a specific concern?
    ```
    
    ```txt title="Prompt"
    You are helping schedule a medical appointment.
    
    Determine appointment type, urgency, and preferred timing.
    Be helpful and accommodating. Keep responses under 25 words.
    ```
  </Step>

  <Step title="Add Global Emergency Detection Node">
    Create a global node that monitors for emergency keywords throughout the call:
    
    ```txt title="Condition"
    Emergency keywords detected or life-threatening symptoms mentioned
    ```
    
    **Node Name**: `emergency_detector`
    **Global Node**: `enabled = true`
    **Enter Condition**: `{{ emergency_keywords_detected == true or red_flag_symptoms == true }}`
    
    ```txt title="First Message"
    I'm hearing some concerning symptoms. For your safety, I need to direct you to immediate medical care. Please call 911 or go to your nearest emergency room right away. Do not drive yourself - have someone else drive you or call an ambulance.
    ```
    
    ```txt title="Prompt"
    You are handling a medical emergency situation.
    
    Direct them to emergency services immediately. Be clear and calm.
    Do not provide medical advice beyond directing to emergency care.
    Keep the message brief but urgent.
    ```
    
    This global node will activate whenever emergency keywords are detected, regardless of where they are in the workflow.
  </Step>

  <Step title="Add Triage Assessment Flow">
    For the medical triage path, add these nodes:

    **Symptom Collection Node**:
    
    ```txt title="Condition"
    Initial symptoms described
    ```
    
    **Node Name**: `collect_symptoms`
    
    ```txt title="First Message"
    Thank you for that information. On a scale of 1 to 10, how would you rate your pain or discomfort? And have you tried anything to help with these symptoms?
    ```
    
    ```txt title="Prompt"
    You are collecting detailed symptom information for medical triage.
    
    Get pain scale, duration, what makes it better/worse, and any self-treatment.
    Follow medical assessment protocols. Keep responses under 30 words.
    ```
    
    **Extract Variables**:
    - Variable: `symptom_details`
    - Type: `String`
    - Description: `Detailed symptom description`
    <br />
    - Variable: `pain_scale`
    - Type: `String`
    - Description: `Pain level 1-10`
    <br />
    - Variable: `symptom_duration`
    - Type: `String`
    - Description: `How long symptoms have been present`

    **Triage Protocol Tool Node**:
    
    ```txt title="Condition"
    Comprehensive symptoms collected
    ```
    
    - Add a **Tool** node that calls triage protocol API with symptom data

    **Urgency Classification Node**:
    
    ```txt title="Condition"
    Triage assessment completed
    ```
    
    **Node Name**: `classify_urgency`
    
    ```txt title="First Message"
    Based on your symptoms, I'm going to classify this as [urgency level] and connect you with the appropriate care level.
    ```
    
    ```txt title="Prompt"
    You are communicating the triage classification results to the patient.
    
    Explain the urgency level and next steps clearly.
    Be reassuring while maintaining clinical accuracy.
    Keep responses under 35 words.
    ```
    
    - Determine urgency level: emergency, urgent, semi-urgent, routine
    - Route to appropriate care level
  </Step>

  <Step title="Add Provider Availability Flow">
    **Provider Lookup Tool Node**:
    
    ```txt title="Condition"
    Urgency level determined and provider needed
    ```
    
    - Add a **Tool** node that checks available appointments based on urgency and specialty

    **Appointment Options Node**:
    
    ```txt title="Condition"
    Provider availability checked
    ```
    
    **Node Name**: `present_appointment_options`
    
    ```txt title="First Message"
    Based on your needs, I have these available appointment times with Dr. [Provider Name]. Which option works best for your schedule?
    ```
    
    ```txt title="Prompt"
    You are presenting available medical appointments to the patient.
    
    Present 2-3 time options clearly with provider names.
    Consider urgency when offering times. Keep responses under 35 words.
    ```
    
    - Present available time slots to patient
    - Use conditional logic based on urgency level

    **Appointment Confirmation Node**:
    
    ```txt title="Condition"
    Appointment time selected
    ```
    
    **Node Name**: `confirm_appointment`
    
    ```txt title="First Message"
    Perfect! Let me confirm your appointment with Dr. [Provider] on [date] at [time]. Please arrive 15 minutes early for check-in.
    ```
    
    ```txt title="Prompt"
    You are confirming medical appointment details.
    
    Confirm provider, date, time, and location.
    Provide pre-appointment instructions if needed.
    Keep responses under 30 words.
    ```
    
    - Confirm appointment details and provide instructions
  </Step>

  <Step title="Add Emergency Routing Options">
    **911 Routing Node**:
    
    ```txt title="Condition"
    Life-threatening emergency detected
    ```
    
    **Node Type**: `Transfer`
    **Destination**: `911`
    - Use for life-threatening emergencies

    **Urgent Care Transfer Node**:
    
    ```txt title="Condition"

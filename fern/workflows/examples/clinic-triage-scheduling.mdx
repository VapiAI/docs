## 4. Build the Workflow

You'll start with a default template that includes a "Call Start" node. We'll modify the existing nodes and add new ones to create our medical triage and scheduling workflow.

<Steps>
  <Step title="Configure the Initial Conversation Node">
    The default template includes a conversation node. Click on it and configure:
    
    ```txt title="First Message"
    Hello, you've reached Riverside Family Clinic. This is Nurse Kelly, your medical assistant. I can help you schedule appointments, assess your symptoms, or direct you to appropriate care. How may I assist you today?
    ```
    
    ```txt title="Prompt"
    You are Nurse Kelly, a licensed medical assistant for Riverside Family Clinic.

    Listen to the patient's response and determine their primary need:
    - "symptoms" for medical concerns or illness
    - "appointment" for routine scheduling
    - "prescription" for medication refills
    - "emergency" for urgent medical situations
    - "general" for other inquiries

    Keep responses professional and under 30 words. Always prioritize patient safety.
    ```

    **Extract Variables**:
    - Variable: `call_purpose`
    - Type: `String`
    - Description: `The patient's primary need`
    - Enum Values: `symptoms`, `appointment`, `prescription`, `emergency`, `general`

  </Step>

  <Step title="Add Patient Lookup Tool Node">
    Add a **Tool** node:
    
    ```txt title="Condition"
    Patient information collected
    ```
    
    **Tool**: Select your pre-configured "Patient Lookup" tool from the dropdown. This tool should be created in the **Tools** section of your dashboard with:
    - **Function Name**: `lookup_patient`
    - **Description**: "Look up patient record by ID"
    - **Parameters**: 
      - `patient_id` (string, required): Patient's ID number
    - **Server URL**: `https://jsonplaceholder.typicode.com/users`
  </Step>

  <Step title="Add Purpose-Based Routing">
    Create branching paths based on the patient's needs. Add multiple conversation nodes:

    **Medical Triage Node**:
    
    ```txt title="Condition"
    Patient verified and purpose is symptoms
    ```
    
    **Node Name**: `medical_triage_assessment`
    
    ```txt title="First Message"
    I understand you're having some medical concerns. Let me ask you some questions to better assess your situation. What symptoms are you experiencing, and when did they start?
    ```
    
    ```txt title="Prompt"
    You are conducting a medical triage assessment following clinical protocols.
    
    Ask about symptoms, onset, severity, and any concerning signs.

    ```
  </Step>

  <Step title="Configure Flow Conditions">
    Connect the nodes with conditions for the LLM to interpret:

    **To Medical Triage Node**:
    - Condition: `Patient verified and purpose is symptoms`

    **To Routine Appointment Node**:
    - Condition: `Patient verified and purpose is appointment`

    **To Prescription Refill Node**:
    - Condition: `Patient verified and purpose is prescription`

    **To Emergency Assessment Node**:
    - Condition: `Patient verified and purpose is emergency`
  </Step>

  <Step title="Add Global Emergency Detection Node">
    Create a global node that monitors for emergency keywords throughout the call:
    
    ```txt title="Condition"
    Emergency keywords detected or life-threatening symptoms mentioned
    ```
    
    **Node Name**: `emergency_detector`
    **Global Node**: `enabled = true`
    **Enter Condition**: `{{ emergency_keywords_detected == true or red_flag_symptoms == true }}`
    
    ```txt title="First Message"
    I'm hearing some concerning symptoms. For your safety, I need to direct you to immediate medical care. Please call 911 or go to your nearest emergency room right away. Do not drive yourself - have someone else drive you or call an ambulance.
    ```
    
    ```txt title="Prompt"
    You are handling a medical emergency situation.
    
    Direct them to emergency services immediately. Be clear and calm.
    Do not provide medical advice beyond directing to emergency care.
    Keep the message brief but urgent.
    ```
    
    This global node will activate whenever emergency keywords are detected, regardless of where they are in the workflow.
  </Step>

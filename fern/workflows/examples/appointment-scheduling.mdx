description: Build a voice AI appointment scheduling workflow with calendar integration, availability checking, and automated confirmations using Vapi's workflow builder.
---

## Overview

Build an AI-powered appointment scheduling workflow that handles inbound calls for booking, rescheduling, and canceling appointments. The workflow uses visual nodes to create branching logic, integrates with calendar systems, checks availability in real-time, and sends confirmation messages.

**What You'll Build:**
* Visual workflow with branching appointment logic
* Real-time calendar integration and availability checking
* Customer database with automated confirmations
* Global nodes for error handling and validation
* 24/7 phone booking with conditional routing

## Prerequisites

* A [Vapi account](https://dashboard.vapi.ai/).
* A Google Calendar account (or other calendar service).

## Scenario

We will be creating an appointment scheduling workflow for Tony's Barbershop, a traditional barbershop that wants to automate their phone booking process with sophisticated branching logic to handle different appointment scenarios.

## Final Workflow

## 3. Build the Workflow

You'll start with a default template that includes a "Call Start" node. We'll modify the existing nodes and add new ones to create our appointment scheduling workflow.

<Steps>
  <Step title="Configure the Initial Conversation Node">
    The default template includes a conversation node. Click on it and configure:
    
    ```txt title="First Message"
    Hello! Thank you for calling Tony's Barbershop. This is Sarah, your booking assistant. I can help you schedule, reschedule, or cancel appointments. How can I help you today?
    ```
    
    ```txt title="Prompt"
    You are Sarah, the friendly booking assistant for Tony's Barbershop. 

    Listen to the customer's response and determine their intent:
    - "schedule" for new appointments
    - "reschedule" for changing existing appointments  
    - "cancel" for canceling appointments
    - "status" for checking appointment details
    - "other" for anything else

    Keep responses under 35 words. Ask clarifying questions if intent is unclear.
    ```

    **Extract Variables**:
    - Variable: `intent`
    - Type: `String`
    - Description: `The customer's primary intent`
    - Enum Values: `schedule`, `reschedule`, `cancel`, `status`, `other`
  </Step>

  <Step title="Add Customer Verification Node">
    Click the + button below the greeting node and add a new **Conversation** node:
    
    ```txt title="Condition"
    Intent identified
    ```

    ```txt title="First Message"
    Now I need to verify your information. Can you please provide your phone number or full name so I can look up your account?
    ```
    
    ```txt title="Prompt"
    You are collecting customer identification information to look them up in the system.

    If they provide a phone number, extract it in a clean format (numbers only).
    If they provide a name, extract their full name.
    Be friendly and reassuring about privacy. Keep responses under 25 words.
    ```

    **Extract Variables**:
    - Variable: `phone_number`
    - Type: `String` 
    - Description: `Customer's phone number if provided`
    <br />
    - Variable: `customer_name`
    - Type: `String`
    - Description: `Customer's full name if provided`
  </Step>

  <Step title="Add Customer Lookup Tool Node">
    Add a **Tool** node:
    
    ```txt title="Condition"
    Customer information collected
    ```
    
    **Select Tool**: Choose your pre-configured customer lookup tool from the dropdown. This tool will use the extracted `phone_number` and `customer_name` variables to find the customer in your database.
  </Step>

  <Step title="Add Intent Routing Logic">
    Create branching paths based on the customer's intent. Add multiple conversation nodes:

    **Schedule New Appointment Node**:
    
    ```txt title="Condition"
    Customer verified and intent is schedule
    ```
    
    ```txt title="First Message"
    Great! I can help you schedule a new appointment. What type of service would you like? We offer haircuts, beard trims, shampoo and styling, and full grooming packages.
    ```
    
    ```txt title="Prompt"
    You are helping the customer schedule a new appointment.
    
    Listen for the service they want and any preferred dates/times they mention.
    Be enthusiastic and helpful. Keep responses under 30 words.
    If they're unsure about services, briefly describe each option.
    ```

    **Reschedule Appointment Node**:
    
    ```txt title="Condition"
    Customer verified and intent is reschedule
    ```
    
    ```txt title="First Message"
    I can help you reschedule your appointment. Let me first look up your current booking details.
    ```
    
    ```txt title="Prompt"
    You are helping the customer reschedule an existing appointment.
    
    Be understanding and accommodating. Look up their current appointment first.
    Keep responses under 25 words while being empathetic.
    ```

    **Cancel Appointment Node**:
    
    ```txt title="Condition"
    Customer verified and intent is cancel
    ```
    
    ```txt title="First Message"
    I can help you cancel your appointment. Let me look up your current booking to confirm the details.
    ```
    
    ```txt title="Prompt"
    You are helping the customer cancel their appointment.
    
    Be understanding and offer to reschedule instead if appropriate.
    Confirm cancellation details before proceeding. Keep responses under 25 words.
    ```
  </Step>

  <Step title="Add Global Error Handling Node">
    Create a global conversation node that checks for errors after every step:
    
    ```txt title="Condition"
    Customer confused or error detected
    ```
    
    ```txt title="First Message"
    I apologize for any confusion. Let me transfer you to one of our human staff members who can better assist you. Please hold for just a moment.
    ```
    
    ```txt title="Prompt"
    You are handling an error or confused customer situation.
    
    Be apologetic and professional. Prepare them for transfer to human staff.
    Keep the message brief and reassuring.
    ```
    
    This global node will activate whenever there's an error or the customer becomes frustrated, regardless of where they are in the workflow.
  </Step>

  <Step title="Add Availability Checking Flow">
    For the schedule appointment flow, add these nodes:

    **Service Selection Node** (Conversation):
    
    ```txt title="Condition"
    Service type mentioned or requested
    ```
    
    ```txt title="First Message"
    Perfect! And when would you prefer to come in? What date and time work best for you?
    ```
    
    ```txt title="Prompt"
    You are collecting appointment preferences for scheduling.
    
    Listen for specific dates, times, or general preferences like "morning" or "next week".
    Be flexible and offer to check availability. Keep responses under 25 words.
    ```
    
    **Extract Variables**: 
    - Variable: `service_type`
    - Type: `String`
    - Description: `Type of service requested`
    <br />
    - Variable: `preferred_date`
    - Type: `String`
    - Description: `Customer's preferred date`
    <br />
    - Variable: `preferred_time`
    - Type: `String`
    - Description: `Customer's preferred time`

    **Availability Check Tool Node**:
    
    ```txt title="Condition"
    Preferences collected
    ```
    
    **Select Tool**: Choose "Check Availability" from the pre-defined calendar tools
    - This will automatically check available slots based on the extracted preferences

    **Availability Results Node** (Conversation):
    
    ```txt title="Condition"
    Availability checked
    ```
    
    ```txt title="First Message"
    Based on your preferences, here are the available time slots. Which one works best for you?
    ```
    
    ```txt title="Prompt"
    You are presenting available appointment times to the customer.
    
    Present 2-3 options clearly with dates and times.
    If their preferred time isn't available, offer the closest alternatives.
    Be helpful and accommodating. Keep responses under 35 words.
    ```
  </Step>

  <Step title="Add Confirmation and Booking Flow">
    **Booking Confirmation Node** (Conversation):
    
    ```txt title="Condition"
    Time slot selected
    ```
    
    ```txt title="First Message"
    Perfect! Let me confirm your appointment details: [service] on [date] at [time]. Is this correct?
    ```
    
    ```txt title="Prompt"
    You are confirming appointment details before booking.
    
    Read back the service type, date, and time clearly.
    Wait for their confirmation before proceeding.
    Be thorough but concise. Keep responses under 30 words.
    ```
    
    **Extract Variables**: 
    - Variable: `confirmation_status`
    - Type: `String`
    - Description: `Whether customer confirms the appointment details`

    **Create Appointment Tool Node**:
    
    ```txt title="Condition"
    Appointment details confirmed
    ```
    
    **Select Tool**: Choose "Schedule Event" from the pre-defined calendar tools
    - This will book the appointment in your calendar system

    **Send Confirmation Node** (Tool):
    
    ```txt title="Condition"
    Appointment created successfully
    ```
    
    **Select Tool**: Choose your pre-configured SMS/email confirmation tool

    **Completion Node** (Conversation):
    
    ```txt title="Condition"
    Confirmation sent
    ```
    
    ```txt title="First Message"
    Great! Your appointment is confirmed. You'll receive a confirmation message shortly. Is there anything else I can help you with today?
    ```
    
    ```txt title="Prompt"
    You are wrapping up a successful appointment booking.
    
    Be friendly and offer additional assistance.
    If they say no, prepare to end the call politely.
    Keep responses under 25 words.
    ```
  </Step>

  <Step title="Add Transfer and Hangup Options">
    **Transfer to Human Node**:
    
    ```txt title="Condition"
    Customer requests human assistance
    ```
    
    **Node Type**: `Transfer Call`
    **Phone to transfer to**: `+1-555-BARBER-1` (your barbershop number)

    **End Call Node**:
    
    ```txt title="Condition"
    Customer satisfied and no further assistance needed
    ```
    
    **Node Type**: `End Call`
    **First Message**: `Thank you for calling Tony's Barbershop. Have a great day!`
    - Use when customer is satisfied and no further assistance needed

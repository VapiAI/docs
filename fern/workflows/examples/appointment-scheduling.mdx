## Overview

Build an AI-powered appointment scheduling workflow that handles inbound calls for booking, rescheduling, and canceling appointments. The workflow uses visual nodes to create branching logic, integrates with calendar systems, checks availability in real-time, and sends confirmation messages.

**What You'll Build:**
* Visual workflow with branching appointment logic
* Real-time calendar integration and availability checking
* Customer database with automated confirmations
* Global nodes for error handling and validation
* 24/7 phone booking with conditional routing

## Prerequisites

* A [Vapi account](https://dashboard.vapi.ai/).
* A Google Calendar account (or other calendar service).

## Scenario

We will be creating an appointment scheduling workflow for Tony's Barbershop, a traditional barbershop that wants to automate their phone booking process with sophisticated branching logic to handle different appointment scenarios.

## 1. Create a Knowledge Base

<Steps>
  <Step title="Download the spreadsheets">
    <div className="flex gap-2">
      <Download src="../../static/spreadsheets/appointment-scheduling/services.csv">
        <Button intent="primary">Download services.csv</Button>
      </Download>
      <Download src="../../static/spreadsheets/appointment-scheduling/customers.csv">
        <Button intent="primary">Download customers.csv</Button>
      </Download>
      <Download src="../../static/spreadsheets/appointment-scheduling/appointments.csv">
        <Button intent="primary">Download appointments.csv</Button>
      </Download>
    </div>
  </Step>
  <Step title="Navigate to the Files section">
    In your Vapi dashboard, click `Files` in the left sidebar.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Upload the spreadsheets">
    - Click `Choose file`. Upload all three CSV files: `services.csv`, `customers.csv`, and `appointments.csv`.
    - Note the file IDs. We'll need them later to create tools.
  </Step>
</Steps>

## 3. Build the Workflow

You'll start with a default template that includes a "Call Start" node. We'll modify the existing nodes and add new ones to create our appointment scheduling workflow.

<Steps>
  <Step title="Configure the Initial Conversation Node">
    The default template includes a conversation node. Click on it and configure:
    
    **First Message**:
    ```txt
    Hello! Thank you for calling Tony's Barbershop. This is Sarah, your booking assistant. I can help you schedule, reschedule, or cancel appointments. How can I help you today?
    ```
    
    **Prompt**:
    ```txt
    You are Sarah, the friendly booking assistant for Tony's Barbershop. 

    Listen to the customer's response and determine their intent:
    - "schedule" for new appointments
    - "reschedule" for changing existing appointments  
    - "cancel" for canceling appointments
    - "status" for checking appointment details
    - "other" for anything else

    Keep responses under 35 words. Ask clarifying questions if intent is unclear.
    ```

    **Extract Variables**:
    - Variable: `intent`
    - Type: `String`
    - Description: `The customer's primary intent`
    - Enum Values: `schedule`, `reschedule`, `cancel`, `status`, `other`
  </Step>

  <Step title="Add Customer Verification Node">
    Click the + button below the greeting node and add a new **Conversation** node:
    
    **Condition**:
    ```txt
    Intent identified
    ```

    **First Message**:
    ```txt
    Now I need to verify your information. Can you please provide your phone number or full name so I can look up your account?
    ```
    
    **Prompt**:
    ```txt
    You are collecting customer identification information to look them up in the system.

    If they provide a phone number, extract it in a clean format (numbers only).
    If they provide a name, extract their full name.
    Be friendly and reassuring about privacy. Keep responses under 25 words.
    ```

    **Extract Variables**:
    - Variable: `phone_number`
    - Type: `String` 
    - Description: `Customer's phone number if provided`
    <br />
    - Variable: `customer_name`
    - Type: `String`
    - Description: `Customer's full name if provided`
  </Step>

  <Step title="Add Customer Lookup Tool Node">
    Add a **Tool** node:
    
    **Condition**:
    ```txt
    Customer information collected
    ```
    
    **Select Tool**: Choose your pre-configured customer lookup tool from the dropdown. This tool will use the extracted `phone_number` and `customer_name` variables to find the customer in your database.
  </Step>

  <Step title="Add Intent Routing Logic">
    Create branching paths based on the customer's intent. Add multiple conversation nodes:

    **Schedule New Appointment Node**:
    
    **Condition**:
    ```txt
    Customer verified and intent is schedule
    ```
    
    **First Message**:
    ```txt
    Great! I can help you schedule a new appointment. What type of service would you like? We offer haircuts, beard trims, shampoo and styling, and full grooming packages.
    ```
    
    **Prompt**:
    ```txt
    You are helping the customer schedule a new appointment.
    
    Listen for the service they want and any preferred dates/times they mention.
    Be enthusiastic and helpful. Keep responses under 30 words.
    If they're unsure about services, briefly describe each option.
    ```

    **Reschedule Appointment Node**:
    
    **Condition**:
    ```txt
    Customer verified and intent is reschedule
    ```
    
    **First Message**:
    ```txt
    I can help you reschedule your appointment. Let me first look up your current booking details.
    ```
    
    **Prompt**:
    ```txt
    You are helping the customer reschedule an existing appointment.
    
    Be understanding and accommodating. Look up their current appointment first.
    Keep responses under 25 words while being empathetic.
    ```

    **Cancel Appointment Node**:
    
    **Condition**:
    ```txt
    Customer verified and intent is cancel
    ```
    
    **First Message**:
    ```txt
    I can help you cancel your appointment. Let me look up your current booking to confirm the details.
    ```
    
    **Prompt**:
    ```txt
    You are helping the customer cancel their appointment.
    
    Be understanding and offer to reschedule instead if appropriate.
    Confirm cancellation details before proceeding. Keep responses under 25 words.
    ```
  </Step>

  <Step title="Add Global Error Handling Node">
    Create a global conversation node that checks for errors after every step:
    
    **Enable Global Node**: Toggle this on to make the node available from any point in the conversation
    
    **Condition**:
    ```txt
    Customer confused or error detected
    ```
    
    **First Message**:
    ```txt
    I apologize for any confusion. Let me transfer you to one of our human staff members who can better assist you. Please hold for just a moment.
    ```
    
    **Prompt**:
    ```txt
    You are handling an error or confused customer situation.
    
    Be apologetic and professional. Prepare them for transfer to human staff.
    Keep the message brief and reassuring.
    ```
    
    This global node will activate whenever there's an error or the customer becomes frustrated, regardless of where they are in the workflow.

    **Prompt**:
    ```txt
    You are collecting appointment preferences for scheduling.

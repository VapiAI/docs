<Warning>
This example uses Workflows. For new builds, use **Squads** with a router assistant and domain specialists. See: [Squad - Property Management Routing](/squads/examples/property-management).
</Warning>

## Overview

Build a property management call routing workflow that determines transfer destinations dynamically using tenant verification, inquiry type analysis, and real-time agent availability. This approach uses visual workflow nodes with API Request nodes for maximum routing flexibility.

**Workflow Capabilities:**
* Tenant status verification and prioritization
* Inquiry type classification for specialist routing
* Real-time agent availability and queue management
* Emergency routing for urgent maintenance issues

**What You'll Build:**
* Visual workflow with conditional routing logic
* API Request nodes for dynamic destination logic
* Tenant verification with CRM integration
* Emergency escalation with priority queuing

## Quick Start: Create the Complete Workflow

Use this cURL command to create the entire property management workflow in one shot:

<CodeBlocks>
```bash title="Complete Workflow Creation"
curl -X POST https://api.vapi.ai/workflow \
     -H "Authorization: Bearer $VAPI_API_KEY" \
     -H "Content-Type: application/json" \

       "name": "Property Management Call Router",
       "nodes": [
         {
           "type": "conversation",
           "name": "Initial Greeting",
           "isStart": true,
           "prompt": "You are a helpful property management assistant for Riverside Property Management. Start by greeting the caller and asking how you can help them today.

             "schema": {
               "type": "object",
               "properties": {
                 "emergency_details": {
                   "type": "string",
                   "description": "Brief description of emergency"
                 }

               }
             ]
           }
         }
       ],
       "edges": [
         {
           "from": "Initial Greeting",
           "to": "Emergency Handling",
           "condition": {
             "type": "ai",
             "prompt": "Route to emergency handling if the caller has an emergency or urgent maintenance issue"
           }
         },
         {
           "from": "Initial Greeting",
           "to": "Transfer to General Office",
           "condition": {
             "type": "ai",
             "prompt": "Route to transfer for all non-emergency inquiries (maintenance, lease, rent, general)"
           }
         },
         {
           "from": "Emergency Handling",
           "to": "Transfer to General Office",
           "condition": {
             "type": "ai",
             "prompt": "After gathering emergency details, transfer to office"
           }
         }
       ]
     }'
```
</CodeBlocks>

<Note>
Replace `$VAPI_API_KEY` with your actual API key from the [Vapi Dashboard](https://dashboard.vapi.ai/). Update the phone number in the `transferCall` destination to your actual office number.
</Note>

Once created, you can retrieve the workflow ID and attach it to a phone number for testing.

## Test Workflow Creation

After creating the workflow, you can test it and get the workflow ID:

<CodeBlocks>
```bash title="Get Your Workflow ID"
# First, create the workflow using the command above, then:
curl -X GET https://api.vapi.ai/workflow \
     -H "Authorization: Bearer $VAPI_API_KEY" \
     | jq '.[] | select(.name == "Property Management Call Router") | {id: .id, name: .name, nodes: (.nodes | length), edges: (.edges | length)}'
```

```bash title="Get Specific Workflow Details"
# Replace WORKFLOW_ID with the actual ID from the previous command
curl -X GET https://api.vapi.ai/workflow/WORKFLOW_ID \
     -H "Authorization: Bearer $VAPI_API_KEY" \
     | jq '{id: .id, name: .name, nodes: [.nodes[].name], edges: [.edges[].condition]}'
```

```bash title="Attach Workflow to Phone Number"
# Replace PHONE_NUMBER_ID with your actual phone number ID
curl -X PATCH https://api.vapi.ai/phone-number/PHONE_NUMBER_ID \
     -H "Authorization: Bearer $VAPI_API_KEY" \
     -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
     -d '{
       "workflowId": "WORKFLOW_ID"
     }'
```
</CodeBlocks>

<Note>
You'll need `jq` installed for JSON parsing. On macOS: `brew install jq`, on Ubuntu: `sudo apt-get install jq`
</Note>

## API Response Structure

When you create the workflow, you'll receive a response like this:

```json
{
  "id": "wf_1234567890abcdef",
  "name": "Property Management Call Router",
  "orgId": "org_1234567890abcdef",
  "createdAt": "2024-01-15T10:30:00.000Z",
  "updatedAt": "2024-01-15T10:30:00.000Z",
  "nodes": [
    {
      "id": "greeting",
      "type": "conversation",
      "name": "Initial Greeting",
      "isStart": true,
      "firstMessage": "Hello! You've reached Riverside Property Management...",
      "systemPrompt": "You are a helpful property management assistant...",
      "model": {
        "provider": "openai",
        "model": "gpt-4"
      },
      "extractVariables": [...]
    },
    // ... more nodes
  ],
  "edges": [
    {
      "id": "greeting_to_lookup",
      "source": "greeting",
      "target": "tenant_lookup",
      "condition": "Always route to tenant lookup after greeting"
    },
    // ... more edges
  ]
}
```

### Key Fields for Integration

| Field | Description | Usage |
|-------|-------------|-------|
| `id` | Workflow ID | Use this to attach workflow to phone numbers |
| `name` | Workflow name | For identification in dashboard |
| `nodes` | Array of workflow nodes | Conversation and tool nodes |
| `edges` | Array of connections | Define the flow between nodes |
| `createdAt` | Creation timestamp | For tracking and reference |

### Node Types in This Workflow

- **Conversation Nodes**: Handle AI conversations with tenants
- **Tool Nodes**: Execute API calls for tenant lookup and routing
- **Transfer Nodes**: Route calls to appropriate agents

## Prerequisites

* A [Vapi account](https://dashboard.vapi.ai/)
* Property management system API or tenant database
* (Optional) Agent availability tracking system

## Scenario

We will build a call routing workflow for Riverside Property Management that intelligently routes tenant calls based on their status, inquiry type, and agent availability.

    - `emergency_contact` → Extract from `response.tenant.emergency_contact`
  </Step>
  <Step title="Add error handling">
    Configure what happens if the API call fails:
    - **On Error**: Route to general agent queue
    - **Error Message**: "I'll connect you with our general team who can help."
  </Step>
</Steps>

---

## 3. Build Emergency Routing Logic

<Steps>
  <Step title="Add emergency detection node">

    }
    ```
  </Step>
</Steps>

---

## 5. Add Agent Availability Logic

<Steps>
  <Step title="Create availability checking flow">
    Before each transfer, add an **API Request** to check agent availability:
    
    **URL**: `https://your-system.com/api/agents/availability`
    **Method**: `GET`
    **Query Parameters**: `department={{department}}&priority={{priority}}`
    
    Response includes:
    - Available agents with phone numbers
    - Current queue length
    - Estimated wait times
  </Step>
  <Step title="Add queue management logic">
    Add conditional routing based on availability:
    
    **If agents available**: Direct transfer to agent
    **If queue exists**: Inform caller of wait time and offer callback
    **If all busy**: Route to voicemail or priority callback system
  </Step>
  <Step title="Configure callback handling">
    Add **API Request** node for callback scheduling:
    
    **URL**: `https://your-system.com/api/callbacks/schedule`
    **Body**:
    ```json
    {
      "tenant_id": "{{tenant_id}}",

      "priority": "{{priority}}",
      "requested_time": "{{preferred_callback_time}}"
    }
    ```
  </Step>
</Steps>

---

## 6. Build Transfer Nodes with Context

<Steps>
  <Step title="Create dynamic transfer destinations">
    Use the API response data to populate transfer nodes:
    
    **Maintenance Transfer**:
    - **Destination**: `{{maintenance_agent_phone}}`
    - **Message**: "Connecting you to {{agent_name}} from our maintenance team."
    - **Transfer Plan**: Include tenant property address and issue details
    
    **Leasing Transfer**:
    - **Destination**: `{{leasing_agent_phone}}`

    - **Message**: "Connecting you with our billing department."
    - **Transfer Plan**: Include account standing and payment history
  </Step>
  <Step title="Configure transfer context">
    Each transfer node should include rich context:
    
    ```txt title="Transfer Plan Summary"
    Tenant: {{tenant_name}} at {{property_address}}
    Account Status: {{account_standing}}
    Inquiry Type: {{inquiry_type}}
    Previous Context: {{conversation_summary}}
    Priority: {{priority_level}}
    ```
  </Step>
</Steps>

    - No available agents
    - Unknown inquiry types
    - System errors
    
    **URL**: `https://your-system.com/api/routing/fallback`
    **Body**:
    ```json
    {
      "phone": "{{caller_phone}}",
      "error_type": "{{error_reason}}",
      "original_inquiry": "{{inquiry_type}}"
    }
    ```
  </Step>
  <Step title="Add general queue routing">
    Create **Transfer Call** node for general queue:
    
    **Destination**: Main office line
    **Message**: "Let me connect you with our general team who can assist you."
    **Transfer Plan**: "Call requires general assistance - routing details unavailable"
  </Step>
  <Step title="Configure voicemail option">
    Add **End Call** node with voicemail message:
    
    **Condition**: All agents busy and caller declines callback
    **Message**: "Please leave a detailed voicemail including your name, property address, and the nature of your request. We'll call you back within 4 hours."
  </Step>

## API Integration Examples

Your property management system can integrate with the workflow using these API endpoints:

### Tenant Lookup Endpoint

```http
POST /api/tenants/lookup
Content-Type: application/json

{
  "phone": "+1234567890",
  "inquiry_type": "maintenance"
}
```

**Response:**
```json
{
  "tenant": {
    "id": "tenant_123",
    "name": "John Smith",
    "status": "active",
    "property": "123 Main St, Apt 4B",
    "account_standing": "good"
  },
  "routing_suggestion": "maintenance_team"
}
```

### Agent Availability Check

```http
GET /api/agents/availability?department=maintenance&priority=normal
```

**Response:**
```json
{
  "available_agents": [
    {
      "id": "agent_456",
      "name": "Mike Johnson", 
      "phone": "+15551234567",
      "department": "maintenance"
    }
  ],
  "queue_length": 2,
  "estimated_wait_minutes": 5,
  "department_status": "available"
}
```

### Emergency Routing

```http
POST /api/routing/emergency
Content-Type: application/json

{
  "tenant_id": "tenant_123",
  "property": "123 Main St, Apt 4B",
  "inquiry_type": "emergency"
}
```

**Response:**
```json
{
  "destination": "+15559876543",
  "agent_name": "Emergency Maintenance",
  "ticket_id": "EM_789",
  "priority": "critical"
}
```

## Advanced Workflow Features

### Queue Management with Priorities

Configure priority-based routing in your tenant lookup API:

```json
{
  "tenant": {
    "tier": "commercial",
    "account_standing": "good",
    "inquiry_type": "emergency"
  },
  "routing_priority": "critical"
}
```

Priority levels:
- **Critical**: Emergency situations, commercial tenants
- **High**: Good standing tenants with urgent issues  
- **Normal**: Standard maintenance and lease inquiries
- **Low**: Delinquent accounts with non-urgent matters

### Business Hours Routing

Configure time-based routing logic:

```json
{
  "business_hours": {
    "weekdays": "9:00-17:00",
    "weekends": "10:00-15:00"
  },
  "after_hours_routing": {
    "emergency": "+15559876543",
    "general": "voicemail"
  }
}
```

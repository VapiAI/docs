## Overview

Build a property management call routing workflow that determines transfer destinations dynamically using tenant verification, inquiry type analysis, and real-time agent availability. This approach uses visual workflow nodes with API Request nodes for maximum routing flexibility.

**Workflow Capabilities:**
* Tenant status verification and prioritization
* Inquiry type classification for specialist routing
* Real-time agent availability and queue management
* Emergency routing for urgent maintenance issues

**What You'll Build:**
* Visual workflow with conditional routing logic
* API Request nodes for dynamic destination logic
* Tenant verification with CRM integration
* Emergency escalation with priority queuing

## Quick Start: Create the Complete Workflow

Use this cURL command to create the entire property management workflow in one shot:

<CodeBlocks>
```bash title="Complete Workflow Creation"
curl -X POST https://api.vapi.ai/workflow \
     -H "Authorization: Bearer $VAPI_API_KEY" \
     -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
     -d '{
       "name": "Property Management Call Router",
       "nodes": [
         {
           "type": "conversation",
           "name": "Initial Greeting",
           "isStart": true,
           "prompt": "You are a helpful property management assistant for Riverside Property Management. Start by greeting the caller and asking how you can help them today. Listen to determine: Is this an emergency/urgent maintenance issue? What type of inquiry is this (maintenance, lease, rent, general)? Keep responses under 25 words and be professional.",
           "model": {
             "provider": "openai",

                 "inquiry_type": {
                   "type": "string",
                   "description": "Type of inquiry",
                   "enum": ["emergency", "maintenance", "lease", "rent", "general"]
                 },
                 "caller_phone": {
                   "type": "string",
                   "description": "Caller phone number for tenant lookup"
                 }
               }
             }
           }
         },
         {
           "type": "conversation",
           "name": "Emergency Handling",
           "prompt": "This is an emergency maintenance situation. Tell the caller you understand this is an emergency and that you are immediately connecting them with emergency maintenance. Keep the interaction brief and gather only essential details about the emergency.",
           "model": {
             "provider": "openai",
             "model": "gpt-4"
           },
           "variableExtractionPlan": {
             "schema": {
               "type": "object",
               "properties": {
                 "emergency_details": {
                   "type": "string",
                   "description": "Brief description of emergency"
                 }
               }
             }
           }
         },
         {
           "type": "tool",
           "name": "Transfer to General Office",
           "tool": {
             "type": "transferCall",
             "destinations": [
               {
                 "type": "number",
                 "number": "+12025551234",
                 "message": "Connecting you to our office team who will assist you with your inquiry."
               }
             ]
           }
         }
       ],
       "edges": [
         {
           "from": "Initial Greeting",
           "to": "Emergency Handling",
           "condition": {
             "type": "ai",
             "prompt": "Route to emergency handling if the caller has an emergency or urgent maintenance issue"
           }
         },
         {
           "from": "Initial Greeting",
           "to": "Transfer to General Office",
           "condition": {
             "type": "ai",
             "prompt": "Route to transfer for all non-emergency inquiries (maintenance, lease, rent, general)"
           }
         },
         {
           "from": "Emergency Handling",
           "to": "Transfer to General Office",
           "condition": {
             "type": "ai",
             "prompt": "After gathering emergency details, transfer to office"
           }
         }
       ]
     }'
```
</CodeBlocks>

<Note>
Replace `$VAPI_API_KEY` with your actual API key from the [Vapi Dashboard](https://dashboard.vapi.ai/). Update the phone number in the `transferCall` destination to your actual office number.
</Note>

Once created, you can retrieve the workflow ID and attach it to a phone number for testing.

## Test Workflow Creation

After creating the workflow, you can test it and get the workflow ID:

<CodeBlocks>
```bash title="Get Your Workflow ID"
# First, create the workflow using the command above, then:
curl -X GET https://api.vapi.ai/workflow \
     -H "Authorization: Bearer $VAPI_API_KEY" \
     | jq '.[] | select(.name == "Property Management Call Router") | {id: .id, name: .name, nodes: (.nodes | length), edges: (.edges | length)}'
```

```bash title="Get Specific Workflow Details"
# Replace WORKFLOW_ID with the actual ID from the previous command
curl -X GET https://api.vapi.ai/workflow/WORKFLOW_ID \
     -H "Authorization: Bearer $VAPI_API_KEY" \
     | jq '{id: .id, name: .name, nodes: [.nodes[].name], edges: [.edges[].condition]}'
```

```bash title="Attach Workflow to Phone Number"
# Replace PHONE_NUMBER_ID with your actual phone number ID
curl -X PATCH https://api.vapi.ai/phone-number/PHONE_NUMBER_ID \
     -H "Authorization: Bearer $VAPI_API_KEY" \
     -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
     -d '{
       "workflowId": "WORKFLOW_ID"
     }'
```
</CodeBlocks>

<Note>
You'll need `jq` installed for JSON parsing. On macOS: `brew install jq`, on Ubuntu: `sudo apt-get install jq`
</Note>

## API Response Structure

When you create the workflow, you'll receive a response like this:

```json
{
  "id": "wf_1234567890abcdef",
  "name": "Property Management Call Router",
  "orgId": "org_1234567890abcdef",
  "createdAt": "2024-01-15T10:30:00.000Z",
  "updatedAt": "2024-01-15T10:30:00.000Z",
  "nodes": [
    {
      "id": "greeting",
      "type": "conversation",
      "name": "Initial Greeting",
      "isStart": true,
      "firstMessage": "Hello! You've reached Riverside Property Management...",
      "systemPrompt": "You are a helpful property management assistant...",
      "model": {
        "provider": "openai",
        "model": "gpt-4"
      },
      "extractVariables": [...]
    },
    // ... more nodes
  ],
  "edges": [
    {
      "id": "greeting_to_lookup",
      "source": "greeting",
      "target": "tenant_lookup",
      "condition": "Always route to tenant lookup after greeting"
    },
    // ... more edges
  ]
}
```

### Key Fields for Integration

| Field | Description | Usage |
|-------|-------------|-------|
| `id` | Workflow ID | Use this to attach workflow to phone numbers |
| `name` | Workflow name | For identification in dashboard |
| `nodes` | Array of workflow nodes | Conversation and tool nodes |
| `edges` | Array of connections | Define the flow between nodes |
| `createdAt` | Creation timestamp | For tracking and reference |

### Node Types in This Workflow

- **Conversation Nodes**: Handle AI conversations with tenants
- **Tool Nodes**: Execute API calls for tenant lookup and routing
- **Transfer Nodes**: Route calls to appropriate agents

## Prerequisites

* A [Vapi account](https://dashboard.vapi.ai/)
* Property management system API or tenant database
* (Optional) Agent availability tracking system

## Scenario

We will build a call routing workflow for Riverside Property Management that intelligently routes tenant calls based on their status, inquiry type, and agent availability.

    - **Transfer Plan**: Include account standing and payment history
  </Step>
  <Step title="Configure transfer context">
    Each transfer node should include rich context:
    
    ```txt title="Transfer Plan Summary"
    Tenant: {{tenant_name}} at {{property_address}}
    Account Status: {{account_standing}}
    Inquiry Type: {{inquiry_type}}
    Previous Context: {{conversation_summary}}
    Priority: {{priority_level}}
    ```
  </Step>
</Steps>

    - System errors
    
    **URL**: `https://your-system.com/api/routing/fallback`
    **Body**:
    ```json
    {
      "phone": "{{caller_phone}}",
      "error_type": "{{error_reason}}",
      "original_inquiry": "{{inquiry_type}}"
    }
    ```
  </Step>
  <Step title="Add general queue routing">

## API Integration Examples

Your property management system can integrate with the workflow using these API endpoints:

### Tenant Lookup Endpoint

```http
POST /api/tenants/lookup
Content-Type: application/json

{
  "phone": "+1234567890",
  "inquiry_type": "maintenance"
}
```

**Response:**
```json
{
  "tenant": {
    "id": "tenant_123",
    "name": "John Smith",
    "status": "active",
    "property": "123 Main St, Apt 4B",
    "account_standing": "good"
  },
  "routing_suggestion": "maintenance_team"
}
```

### Agent Availability Check

```http
GET /api/agents/availability?department=maintenance&priority=normal
```

**Response:**
```json
{
  "available_agents": [
    {
      "id": "agent_456",
      "name": "Mike Johnson", 
      "phone": "+15551234567",
      "department": "maintenance"
    }
  ],
  "queue_length": 2,
  "estimated_wait_minutes": 5,
  "department_status": "available"
}
```

### Emergency Routing

```http
POST /api/routing/emergency
Content-Type: application/json

{
  "tenant_id": "tenant_123",
  "property": "123 Main St, Apt 4B",
  "inquiry_type": "emergency"
}
```

**Response:**
```json
{
  "destination": "+15559876543",
  "agent_name": "Emergency Maintenance",
  "ticket_id": "EM_789",
  "priority": "critical"
}
```

## Advanced Workflow Features

### Queue Management with Priorities

Configure priority-based routing in your tenant lookup API:

```json
{
  "tenant": {
    "tier": "commercial",
    "account_standing": "good",
    "inquiry_type": "emergency"
  },
  "routing_priority": "critical"
}
```

Priority levels:
- **Critical**: Emergency situations, commercial tenants
- **High**: Good standing tenants with urgent issues  
- **Normal**: Standard maintenance and lease inquiries
- **Low**: Delinquent accounts with non-urgent matters

### Business Hours Routing

Configure time-based routing logic:

```json
{
  "business_hours": {
    "weekdays": "9:00-17:00",
    "weekends": "10:00-15:00"
  },
  "after_hours_routing": {
    "emergency": "+15559876543",
    "general": "voicemail"
  }
}
```

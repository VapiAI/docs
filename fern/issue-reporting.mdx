To help us assist you as quickly and accurately as possible, it's essential to provide specific and actionable details when reporting issues. Vague messages like "X is not working" slow down the resolution process.

This guide will help you structure your reports to get the best support experience.

## Types of Issues

We handle three main categories of issues. Choose the appropriate category and follow the specific guidelines for faster resolution:

## Assistant-Related Issues

If you're experiencing issues with assistant behavior, voice quality, transcription accuracy, or call connectivity, follow these guidelines:

### Required Information

When reporting assistant-related issues, always include:

- **Call ID** from the test call
- **Timestamp** where the issue occurred in the recording
- **Detailed description** of what happened
- **Expected behavior** vs. actual behavior
- **Screen recording** (for web-based calls showing the issue)

### Finding Your Call ID

<Steps>
  <Step title="Access the Dashboard">
    Navigate to [https://dashboard.vapi.ai/calls](https://dashboard.vapi.ai/calls)
  </Step>
  <Step title="Locate Your Call">
    Find the specific call where the issue occurred
  </Step>
  <Step title="Copy the Call ID">
    Copy the Call ID from the call details
  </Step>
</Steps>

### Example Report Format

```
Call ID: 9ac27e94-74a5-4061-8a0b-3c05389c63bd
Timestamp: 00:30
Issue: The assistant paused for 5 seconds before replying
Expected: The assistant should respond within 1 second without delay
Browser: Chrome 120.0 (if web call)
Screen Recording: [attached/linked]
```

<Note>
If the call never connected or failed completely, simply share the Call ID and we'll investigate the connection logs.
</Note>

### Iterative Debugging Process

Assistant issues often require multiple rounds of testing and refinement. After each change or suggestion from our team:

1. Test the updated configuration
2. Share the new Call ID
3. Describe the results and any improvements
4. Continue until the issue is resolved

This iterative feedback helps us identify and fix issues efficiently.

## Quick Reference

Use this checklist to ensure you're providing the right information for your issue type:

| Issue Type | Required Information |
|------------|---------------------|
| Assistant behavior problems | Call ID, timestamp, issue description, expected behavior, screen recording |
| Call connection failures | Call ID only |
| Dashboard/UI issues | Screen recording, browser info, steps to reproduce, console errors |
| Login or authentication | Email address, screenshots of errors |
| Account upgrades or billing | Organization ID, email address, error screenshots |
| Feature requests | Detailed description of desired functionality |

## Best Practices

- **Be specific**: Instead of "it's not working," describe exactly what happened
- **Include context**: Mention what you were trying to accomplish
- **Test consistently**: Use the same configuration when reproducing issues
- **Document changes**: Keep track of what modifications you've made
- **Record everything**: Screen recordings are invaluable for UI and workflow issues
- **Check console**: Browser console errors provide crucial debugging information

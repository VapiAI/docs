## Overview

Replace visual flows with a Squad: a Router assistant classifies the inquiry and transfers to Maintenance or Leasing specialists. Use a dynamic transfer tool for human escalation.

**Squad Capabilities:**
* Tenant verification and inquiry classification
* Maintenance vs leasing specialist assistants
* Human transfer with warm summary when needed

## 1. Define members

<CodeBlocks>
```json title="Example squad payload"
{
  "members": [
    { "assistant": { "name": "Router", "model": {"provider": "openai", "model": "gpt-4o", "messages": [{"role": "system", "content": "Classify tenant inquiries: emergency, maintenance, leasing, rent, general. Transfer accordingly."}] }, "toolIds": ["TENANT_LOOKUP_ID"], "firstMessage": "Thanks for calling. How can I help?", "firstMessageMode": "assistant-speaks-first" } },
    { "assistant": { "name": "Maintenance", "model": {"provider": "openai", "model": "gpt-4o", "messages": [{"role": "system", "content": "Maintenance specialist. Collect details and prioritize emergencies."}] } } },
    { "assistant": { "name": "Leasing", "model": {"provider": "openai", "model": "gpt-4o", "messages": [{"role": "system", "content": "Leasing specialist. Answer leasing and rent questions."}] } } }
  ]
}
```
</CodeBlocks>

## 2. Transfers and escalation

- Router → Maintenance for emergency/maintenance
- Router → Leasing for leasing/rent/general
- Dynamic transfer tool for human dispatch

## 3. Test

Assign the Squad to a phone number and test each path.

description: Build a multi-assistant clinic experience with specialized assistants for triage, emergency handling, and scheduling using Squads.
---

## Overview

Compose multiple assistants into a Squad for safe, specialized healthcare flows: a triage assistant assesses symptoms, an emergency assistant handles urgent cases, and a scheduler books appointments.

**Squad Capabilities:**
* Structured triage evaluation and safety gates
* Emergency detection → immediate handoff
* Provider matching and scheduling tools
* Transfers preserve full conversation context

## 1. Define members

<CodeBlocks>
```json title="Example squad payload"
{
  "members": [
    { "assistant": { "name": "Triage", "model": {"provider": "openai", "model": "gpt-4o", "messages": [{"role": "system", "content": "Medical triage assistant. Identify red flags."}] }, "firstMessage": "Hello, how can I help you today?", "firstMessageMode": "assistant-speaks-first" } },
    { "assistant": { "name": "Emergency", "model": {"provider": "openai", "model": "gpt-4o", "messages": [{"role": "system", "content": "Emergency protocol assistant. Keep interaction brief and connect immediately."}] } } },
    { "assistant": { "name": "Scheduler", "model": {"provider": "openai", "model": "gpt-4o", "messages": [{"role": "system", "content": "Clinic scheduler. Offer next available slots, then confirm."}] }, "toolIds": ["BOOK_TOOL_ID", "PROVIDER_LOOKUP_ID"] } }
  ]
}
```
</CodeBlocks>

## 2. Configure transfers

- From Triage → Emergency when red flags detected
- From Triage → Scheduler for routine care
- Warm-transfer with a short summary for human escalation

See: [Silent transfers](/squads/silent-transfers).

## 3. Test

Attach a phone number to the Squad (or start with a Squad when creating a call) and test urgent vs routine scenarios.

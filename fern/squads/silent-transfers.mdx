- **The Problem**: In traditional AI call flows, when transferring from one agent to another, announcing the transfer verbally can confuse or annoy callers and disrupt the conversation's flow.
- **The Solution**: Silent transfers keep the call experience _uninterrupted_, so the user doesn’t know multiple assistants are involved. The conversation flows more naturally, boosting customer satisfaction.

If you want to allow your call flow to move seamlessly from one assistant to another _without_ the caller hearing `Please hold while we transfer you` here’s what to do:

1. **Update the Destination Assistant’s First Message**
   - Set the assistant’s `firstMessage` to an _empty string_.
   - Make sure the `firstMessageMode` is set to `assistant-speaks-first-with-model-generated-message`.
2. **Trigger the Transfer from the Source Assistant**

   - In that assistant’s prompt, include a line instructing it to transfer to the desired assistant:

   ```json
   trigger the transferCall tool with 'assistantName' Assistant.
   ```

   - Replace `'assistantName'` with the exact name of the next assistant.

3. **Direct the Destination Assistant’s Behavior**
   - In that assistant’s prompt, include a line instructing it to _`Proceed directly to the Task section without any greetings or small talk.`_
   - This ensures there’s no awkward greeting or “Hello!” when the next assistant begins speaking.

### **Example Usage Scenario**

- **HPMA (Main Assistant)** is talking to the customer. They confirm the order details and then quietly passes the conversation to **HPPA (Payment Assistant)**.
- **HPPA** collects payment details without the customer ever hearing, `We’re now transferring you to the Payment Assistant.` It feels like one continuous conversation.
- Once payment is done, **HPPA** transfers the call again—this time to **HPMA-SA (Main Sub Assistant)**—which takes over final shipping arrangements.

Everything happens smoothly behind the scenes!

## **Squad and Assistant Configurations**

Below are the key JSON examples you’ll need. These show how to structure your assistants and squads so they work together for silent transfers.

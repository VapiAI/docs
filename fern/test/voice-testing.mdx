## Overview

Voice Testing is an end-to-end feature that automates testing of your AI voice agents. Our platform simulates a call from an AI tester that interacts with your voice agent by following a pre-defined call script. After the call, the transcript is sent to a language model (LLM) along with your success criteria. The LLM then determines if the call met the defined objectives.

## Creating a Test Suite

Begin by creating a Test Suite that organizes and executes multiple test cases.

<Steps>
  ### Step 1: Create a New Test Suite
    - Navigate to the **Test** tab in your dashboard and select **Voice Testing**.
    - Click the **Create Test Suite** button.

  ### Step 2: Define Test Suite Details
    - Enter a title for your Test Suite.
    - Select a phone number from your organization using the dropdown.

  ### Step 3: Add Test Cases
    - Once your Test Suite is created, you will see a table where you can add test cases.
    - Click **Add Test Case** to add a new test case (up to 50 can be added).

  ### Step 4: Configure Each Test Case
    - **Caller Behavior:** Define how the testing agent should behave, including a detailed multi-step prompt that outlines the customer's intent, emotions, and interaction style.
    - **Success Criteria:** List one or more questions that an LLM will use to evaluate if the call was successful.
    - **Attempts:** Choose the number of times (up to 5) the test case should be executed each time the Test Suite is run.

  ### Step 5: Run and Review Tests
    - Click **Run Tests** to execute all test cases one by one.
    - While tests are running, you will see a loading state.
    - Upon completion, a table displays the outcomes with check marks (success) or x-marks (failure).
    - Click on a test row to view detailed results: a dropdown shows each attempt, the LLM's reasoning, the transcript of the call, the defined caller behavior, and the success criteria.

  ### Step 6: Export Results
    - You can export the test results as a CSV file for further analysis.
</Steps>

## Test Execution and Evaluation

When you run a Test Suite, the following steps occur:

- **Call Simulation:** An AI voice agent dials your voice agent, executing the pre-defined script.
- **Transcript Capture:** The entire conversation is transcribed, capturing both the caller's behavior and your voice agent's responses.
- **Automated Evaluation:** The transcript, along with your Success Criteria, is processed by an LLM to determine if the call was successful.
- **Results Display:** Each test case outcome is shown with details. Clicking on a test case reveals:
  - The number of attempts made.
  - The LLM's reasoning for each attempt.
  - The complete call transcript.
  - The configured caller behavior and success criteria.
- **CSV Export:** Results can be exported for additional review or compliance purposes.

## Example Test Cases

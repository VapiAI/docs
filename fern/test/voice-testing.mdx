## Overview

Voice Test Suites enable you to test your AI voice agents through simulated phone conversations. Our platform connects two AI agents - your voice agent and our testing agent - on a real phone call, following your predefined scripts to evaluate performance under various scenarios.

## How Voice Testing Works

1. **Simulation:** Our AI tester calls your voice agent and follows a script that simulates real customer behavior.
2. **Conversation:** Both AIs engage in a natural voice conversation, with the tester following your script guidelines.
3. **Recording:** The entire call is recorded and transcribed for evaluation.
4. **Assessment:** After the call, the transcript is evaluated against your rubric by a language model (LLM).

## Benefits of Voice Testing

- **Natural Interaction:** Test your voice agent in the most realistic scenario - actual phone calls.
- **Audio Quality Assessment:** Evaluate not just responses but also voice clarity, tone, and cadence.
- **End-to-End Verification:** Confirm that your entire voice pipeline works correctly from telephony to response.

## Creating Voice Tests

You can create voice tests as part of a Test Suite:

1. Navigate to the **Test** tab and select **Test Suites**.
2. Create a new Test Suite or edit an existing one.
3. When adding tests, select **Voice** as the test type.
4. Define your script and success criteria as detailed in the [Test Suites](./test-suites) documentation.

## Voice Test Limitations

- Voice tests require more time to execute compared to chat tests.
- Each test consumes calling minutes from your account.
- Maximum call duration is limited to 15 minutes per test.

For detailed instructions on creating and managing test suites that include voice tests, see the [Test Suites](./test-suites) documentation.

An outbound call is a phone call that is dialed and goes **"out"** from a phone number, & in our case, our AI assistant will be doing the dialing.

There are **3 steps** we will cover to send our first outbound phone call:

1. **Create an Assistant:** we will create an [assistant](/assistants) & instruct it on how to conduct itself during the call
2. **Get a Phone Number:** we can either import existing numbers we own, or create a free one through Vapi
3. **Call Your Number:** we will set our assistant as the dialer, set the destination phone number, then make the call

We can then send the outbound call, hopefully someone picks up!

<Warning>
  It is a violation of FCC law to dial phone numbers without consent in an
  automated manner. See [Telemarketing Sales
  Rule](/glossary#telemarketing-sales-rule) to learn more.

## Vapi’s Pizzeria

We will be implementing a simple order-taking assistant for a pizza shop called “Vapi’s Pizzeria”.

Vapi’s has 3 types of menu items: `pizza`, `side`s, & `drink`s. Customers will be ordering 1 of each.

**Outbound Scenario:** We will imagine we are calling back a customer who originally called in to place an order. Our assistant is calling back to complete the ordering process with the customer.

<Frame caption="Customers can order 3 items: 1 pizza, 1 side, & 1 drink. The assistant will call the customer (who got disconnected) & finish the ordering process.">

</Frame>

## Assistant Setup

First we're going to set up our assistant in the dashboard. Once our assistant’s **transcriber**, **model**, & **voice** are set up, we can have it call the customer to finish the order.

<Info>
  You can visit your dashboard by going to
  [dashboard.vapi.ai](https://dashboard.vapi.ai)
</Info>

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="Sign-up or Log-in to Vapi" icon="user-plus" iconType="solid">
    If you haven't already signed-up, you're going to need an account before you can use the web dashboard. When you visit [dashboard.vapi.ai](https://dashboard.vapi.ai) you may see something like this:

    <Frame>
      <img src="../static/images/quickstart/dashboard/auth-ui.png" />
    </Frame>

    Sign-up for an account (or log-in to your existing account) — you will then find yourself inside the web dashboard. It will look something like this:

    <Frame caption="Your dashboard may look a bit different if you already have an account with assistants in it. The main idea is that we’re in the dashboard now.">
      <img src="../static/images/quickstart/dashboard/vapi-dashboard-post-signup.png" />
    </Frame>

  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Create an Assistant" icon="layer-plus" iconType="solid">
    Now that you're in your dashboard, we're going to create an [assistant](/assistants).

    Assistants are at the heart of how Vapi models AI voice agents — we will be setting certain properties on a new assistant to model an order-taking agent.

    Once in the "Assistants" dashboard tab (you should be in it by-default after log-in), you will see a button to create a new assistant.

    <Frame caption="Ensure you are in the 'Assistants' dashboard tab, then this button will allow you to begin the assistant creation flow.">
      <img src="../static/images/quickstart/dashboard/create-new-assistant-button.png" />
    </Frame>

    After clicking the create new assistant button, you will see a pop-up modal that asks you to pick a starter template. For our example we will start from a blank slate so choose the `Blank Template` option.

    <Frame caption="Ensure you are in the 'Assistants' dashboard tab, then this button will allow you to begin the assistant creation flow.">
      <img src="../static/images/quickstart/dashboard/choose-blank-template.png" />
    </Frame>

    You will then be able to name your assistant — you can name it whatever you'd like (`Vapi’s Pizza Front Desk`, for example):

    <Info>
      This name is only for internal labeling use. It is not an identifier, nor will the assistant be
      aware of this name.
    </Info>

    <Frame caption="Name your assistant.">
      <img src="../static/images/quickstart/dashboard/name-your-assistant.png" />
    </Frame>

    Once you have named your assistant, you can hit "Create" to create it. You will then see something like this:

    <Frame caption="The assistant overview. You can edit your assistant’s transcriber, model, & voice — and edit other advanced configuration.">
      <img src="../static/images/quickstart/dashboard/assistant-created.png" />
    </Frame>

    This is the assistant overview view — it gives you the ability to edit different attributes about your assistant, as well as see **cost** & **latency** projection information for each portion of it’s voice pipeline (this is very important data to have handy when building out your assistants).

  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Model Setup" icon="microchip" iconType="solid">
    Now we’re going to set the "brains" of the assistant, the large language model. We're going to be using `GPT-4` (from [OpenAI](https://openai.com/)) for this demo (though you're free to use `GPT-3.5`, or any one of your favorite LLMs).

    <AccordionGroup>
      <Accordion title="Set Your OpenAI Provider Key (optional)" icon="key" iconType="solid">
        Before we proceed, we can set our [provider key](customization/provider-keys) for OpenAI (this is just your OpenAI secret key).

        <Note>
          You can see all of your provider keys in the "Provider Keys" dashboard tab. You can also go
          directly to [dashboard.vapi.ai/keys](https://dashboard.vapi.ai/keys).
        </Note>

        Vapi uses [provider keys](customization/provider-keys) you provide to communicate with LLM, TTS, & STT vendors on your behalf. It is most ideal that we set keys for the vendors we intend to use ahead of time.

        <Frame caption="We set our provider key for OpenAI so Vapi can make requests to their API.">
          <img src="../static/images/quickstart/dashboard/model-provider-keys.png" />
        </Frame>

        While we're here it'd be ideal for you to go & set up provider keys for other providers you're familiar with & intend to use later.
      </Accordion>
      <Accordion title="Set a First Message" icon="message" iconType="light">
        Assistants can **optionally** be configured with a `First Message`. This first message will be spoken by your assistant when either:

        - **A Web Call Connects:** when a web call is started with your assistant
        - **An Inbound Call is Picked-up:** an [inbound call](/glossary#inbound-call) is picked-up & answered by your assistant
        - **An Outbound Call is Dialed & Picked-up:** an [outbound call](/glossary#outbound-call) is dialed by your assistant & a person picks up

        <Warning>
          Note that this first message cannot be interrupted & is guaranteed to be spoken. Certain use cases
          need a first message, while others do not.
        </Warning>

        For our use case, we will want a first message. Since we are calling the customer back it would be ideal for us to have a first message like this:

        ```text
        Hi this is Jennifer from Vappy’s Pizzeria giving you a call back since we got disconnected. Would you like to finish your order with us?
        ```

        <Info>
          Some text-to-speech voices may struggle to pronounce 'Vapi' correctly, compartmentalizing it to be
          spoken letter by letter "V. A. P. I."

        Some aspects of configuring your voice pipeline will require tweaks like this to get the target
        behaviour you want.

        </Info>

        This will be spoken by the assistant when a web or inbound phone call is received.
      </Accordion>
      <Accordion title="Set the System Prompt" icon="message" iconType="solid">
        We will now set the `System Prompt` for our assistant. If you're familiar with OpenAI's API, this is the first prompt in the message list that we feed our LLM (learn more about prompt engineering on the [OpenAI docs](https://platform.openai.com/docs/guides/prompt-engineering)).

        The system prompt can be used to configure the context, role, personality, instructions and so on for the assistant.

        Since we are calling the customer back, we will tweak the base prompt a bit so the model understands the situation & new goal (recovering the order).

        A system prompt like this will give us the behaviour we want:

        ```text
        You are a voice assistant for Vappy’s Pizzeria,
        a pizza shop located on the Internet.

        Your job is to take the order of customers calling in. The menu has only 3 types
        of items: pizza, sides, and drinks. There are no other types of items on the menu.

        1) There are 3 kinds of pizza: cheese pizza, pepperoni pizza, and vegetarian pizza
        (often called "veggie" pizza).
        2) There are 3 kinds of sides: french fries, garlic bread, and chicken wings.
        3) There are 2 kinds of drinks: soda, and water. (if a customer asks for a
        brand name like "coca cola", just let them know that we only offer "soda")

        Customers can only order 1 of each item. If a customer tries to order more
        than 1 item within each category, politely inform them that only 1 item per
        category may be ordered.

        Customers must order 1 item from at least 1 category to have a complete order.
        They can order just a pizza, or just a side, or just a drink.

        Be sure to introduce the menu items, don't assume that the caller knows what
        is on the menu (most appropriate at the start of the conversation).

        If the customer goes off-topic or off-track and talks about anything but the
        process of ordering, politely steer the conversation back to collecting their order.

        Once you have all the information you need pertaining to their order, you can
        end the conversation. You can say something like "Awesome, we'll have that ready
        for you in 10-20 minutes." to naturally let the customer know the order has been
        fully communicated.

        It is important that you collect the order in an efficient manner (succinct replies
        & direct questions). You only have 1 task here, and it is to collect the customers
        order, then end the conversation.

        - Be sure to be kind of funny and witty!
        - Keep all your responses short and simple. Use casual language, phrases like "Umm...", "Well...", and "I mean" are preferred.
        - This is a voice conversation, so keep your responses short, like in a real conversation. Don't ramble for too long.

        You are calling back a customer after the call got disconnected while they were
        ordering. Your job is to help them complete their order.
        ```

        You can copy & paste the above prompt into the `System Prompt` field. Now the model configuration for your assistant should look something like this:

        <Frame caption="Note how our model provider is set to OpenAI & the model is set to GPT-4.">

        We will be using [Deepgram](https://deepgram.com) (which provides blazing-fast & accurate Speech-to-Text) as our STT provider.

  <Accordion title="Voice Setup" icon="head-side-cough" iconType="solid">
    The final portion of the voice pipeline is turning LLM output-text into speech. This process is called "Text-to-speech" (or TTS for short).

    We will be using a voice provider called [PlayHT](https://play.ht) (they have very conversational voices), & a voice provided by them labeled `Jennifer` (`female`, `en-US`).

    You are free to use your favorite TTS voice platform here. [ElevenLabs](https://elevenlabs.io/) is
    another alternative — by now you should get the flow of plugging in vendors into Vapi (add
    provider key + pick provider in assistant config).

    You can skip the next step(s) if you don't intend to use PlayHT.

## Get a Phone Number

Now that we've configured how our assistant will behave, we want to figure out how to dial calls with it. We will need a phone number that we can call from.

<Markdown src="../snippets/quickstart/phone/get-a-phone-number.mdx" />

## Call Your Number

We can now make outbound calls to phone numbers, setting our assistant as the one doing the dialing.

In the phone numbers section of the dashboard, go to your phone number detail page. We will:

1. fill out **our own phone number** as the number to dial
2. set our assistant as the one doing the calling

<Frame caption="When we hit the call button, our assistant will make the outbound call to the phone number.">
  <img src="../static/images/quickstart/phone/outbound/dial-outbound-call-dashboard.png" />
</Frame>

You can now hit the call button to make the outbound call. Your assistant will dial the phone number & manage the order recovery process.

<Tip>
  Your assistant won't yet be able to hang-up the phone at the end of the call.
  We will learn more about configuring call end behaviour in later guides.
</Tip>

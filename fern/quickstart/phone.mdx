## Overview

Vapi makes it easy to build voice agents that can make and receive phone calls. In under 5 minutes, you'll create a voice assistant and start talking to it over the phone.

**In this quickstart, you'll learn to:**
- Create an assistant using the dashboard
- Set up a phone number  
- Make your first inbound and outbound calls

## Prerequisites

- [A Vapi account](https://dashboard.vapi.ai)

## Create your first voice assistant

<Steps>
  <Step title="Open the Vapi Dashboard">
    Go to [dashboard.vapi.ai](https://dashboard.vapi.ai) and log in to your account.
  </Step>

  <Step title="Create a new assistant">

  </Step>

  <Step title="Configure your assistant">
    Set the first message and system prompt for your assistant:

    **First message:**
    ```plaintext
    Hi there, this is Alex from TechSolutions customer support. How can I help you today?
    ```

    **System prompt:**
    ```plaintext
    You are Alex, a customer service voice assistant for TechSolutions. Your primary purpose is to help customers resolve issues with their products, answer questions about services, and ensure a satisfying support experience.
    - Sound friendly, patient, and knowledgeable without being condescending
    - Use a conversational tone with natural speech patterns
    - Speak with confidence but remain humble when you don't know something
    - Demonstrate genuine concern for customer issues
    ```
  </Step>
</Steps>

## Set up a phone number

<Steps>
  <Step title="Create a phone number">
    In the Phone Numbers tab, create a free US phone number or import an existing number from another provider.

    <Warning>
      Free Vapi phone numbers are only available for US national use. For international calls, you'll need to import a number from Twilio or another provider.
    </Warning>
  </Step>

  <Step title="Attach your assistant to the number">
    Select your assistant in the inbound settings for your phone number. When this number is called, your assistant will automatically answer.

  </Step>
</Steps>

## Make your first calls

<Steps>
  <Step title="Test inbound calling">
    Call the phone number you just created. Your assistant will pick up and start the conversation with your configured first message.
  </Step>

  <Step title="Try outbound calling">
    In the dashboard, go to the outbound calls section:
    1. Enter your own phone number as the target
    2. Select your assistant
    3. Click "Make Call"

    Your assistant will call you immediately.
  </Step>

  <Step title="Test web calling (optional)">
    You can also test your assistant directly in the dashboard by clicking the call buttonâ€”no phone number required.

## Next steps

Now that you have a working voice assistant:

- **Customize the conversation:** Update the system prompt to match your use case
- **Add tools:** Connect your assistant to external APIs and databases  
- **Configure models:** Try different speech and language models for better performance
- **Scale with APIs:** Use Vapi's REST API to create assistants programmatically

---

## Overview

Vapi makes it easy to build voice agents that can make and receive phone calls. In under 5 minutes, you'll create a voice assistant and start talking to it over the phone.

**In this quickstart, you'll learn to:**
- Create an assistant using the Dashboard or programmatically
- Set up a phone number  
- Make your first inbound and outbound calls

## Prerequisites

- [A Vapi account](https://dashboard.vapi.ai)
- For SDK usage: API key from the Dashboard

<Tip>
**Using the Vapi CLI?** You can create assistants, manage phone numbers, and make calls directly from your terminal:

```bash
# Install the CLI
curl -sSL https://vapi.ai/install.sh | bash

# Login and create an assistant
vapi login
vapi assistant create
```

      </Step>

      <Step title="Attach your assistant to the number">
        Select your assistant in the inbound settings for your phone number. When this number is called, your assistant will automatically answer.

## Make your first calls

<Steps>
  <Step title="Test inbound calling">
    Call the phone number you just created. Your assistant will pick up and start the conversation with your configured first message.
  </Step>

  <Step title="Try outbound calling">
    **Using the Dashboard:**
    
    In the dashboard, go to the outbound calls section:
    1. Enter your own phone number as the target
    2. Select your assistant
    3. Click "Make Call"

          phoneNumberId: 'your-phone-number-id',
          customer: { number: '+1234567890' },
        });
        console.log(call.id);
        ```
      </Tab>

      <Tab title="Python (Server SDK)">
        ```python
        call = client.calls.create(
            assistant_id="your-assistant-id",
            phone_number_id="your-phone-number-id",
            customer={"number": "+1234567890"},
        )
        print(call.id)
        ```
      </Tab>

      <Tab title="cURL">
        ```bash
        curl -X POST "https://api.vapi.ai/call" \
          -H "Authorization: Bearer $VAPI_API_KEY" \
          -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
          -d '{
            "assistant": {
              "assistantId": "your-assistant-id"
            },
            "phoneNumberId": "your-phone-number-id",
            "customer": {
              "number": "+1234567890"
            }
          }'
        ```
      </Tab>
    </Tabs>

    Your assistant will call the specified number immediately.
  </Step>

  <Step title="Test web calling (optional)">
    You can also test your assistant directly in the dashboard by clicking the call buttonâ€”no phone number required.

## Next steps

Now that you have a working voice assistant:

- **Customize the conversation:** Update the system prompt to match your use case
- **Add tools:** Connect your assistant to external APIs and databases  
- **Configure models:** Try different speech and language models for better performance
- **Scale with APIs:** Use Vapi's REST API to create assistants programmatically

subtitle: Learn to make your first phone call with a voice agent
slug: quickstart/phone
---

## Overview

Vapi makes it easy to build voice agents that can make and receive phone calls. In under 5 minutes, you'll create a voice assistant and start talking to it over the phone.

**In this quickstart, you'll learn to:**
- Create an assistant using the Dashboard or programmatically
- Set up a phone number  
- Make your first inbound and outbound calls

## Prerequisites

- [A Vapi account](https://dashboard.vapi.ai)
- For SDK usage: API key from the Dashboard

<Tip>
**Using the Vapi CLI?** You can create assistants, manage phone numbers, and make calls directly from your terminal:

```bash
# Install the CLI
curl -sSL https://vapi.ai/install.sh | bash

# Login and create an assistant
vapi login
vapi assistant create
```

        ```
      </Tab>
    </Tabs>

    Your assistant will call the specified number immediately.
  </Step>

  <Step title="Test web calling (optional)">
    You can also test your assistant directly in the dashboard by clicking the call button—no phone number required.

</Steps>

## Next steps

Now that you have a working voice assistant:

- **Customize the conversation:** Update the system prompt to match your use case
- **Add tools:** Connect your assistant to external APIs and databases  
- **Configure models:** Try different speech and language models for better performance
- **Scale with APIs:** Use Vapi's REST API to create assistants programmatically

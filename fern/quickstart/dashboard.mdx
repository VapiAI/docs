## Overview

Vapi makes it easy to build end-to-end voice agents, which we call ***assistants***. Assistants support live, two-way conversations. You can call an assistant or have it call you. 

**Each assistant has three components:** Speech-to-text (STT), Language model (LLM) and Text-to-speech (TTS). Vapi gives you full control over each, with dozens of providers and models to choose from.

**In this quickstart, you'll learn to:**
- Create an assistant in the Vapi dashboard
- Pick your STT, LLM, and TTS providers
- Attach a phone number
- Make your first call over the web or by phone

## Prerequisites

- [A Vapi account](https://dashboard.vapi.ai)

## Create your assistant

<Tabs>
  <Tab title="Dashboard">
    <Steps>
      <Step title="Open the Vapi Dashboard">
        Go to [dashboard.vapi.ai](https://dashboard.vapi.ai) and log in to your account.
      </Step>

      <Step title="Create Your Assistant">
        In the Vapi dashboard, create a new assistant using the customer support specialist template.

        </Frame>
      </Step>

      <Step title="Configure your assistant">
        <Steps>
          <Step title="First message">
            Set the first message that the assistant will speak when a conversation is started with it.

            ```plaintext First message
            Hi there, this is Alex from TechSolutions customer support. How can I help you today?
            ```
          </Step>

          <Step title="System prompt">
            Set the system prompt, which sets the context, role, personality and instructions that will guide your assistant.

            ```plaintext System Prompt
            You are Alex, a customer service voice assistant for TechSolutions. Your primary purpose is to help customers resolve issues with their products, answer questions about services, and ensure a satisfying support experience.

            ## Core Responsibilities
            - Help customers troubleshoot technical issues
            - Answer questions about products and services
            - Escalate complex issues when necessary
            - Provide accurate information about warranties and policies

            ## Communication Style
            - Sound friendly, patient, and knowledgeable without being condescending
            - Use a conversational tone with natural speech patterns, including occasional "hmm" or "let me think about that" to simulate thoughtfulness
            - Speak with confidence but remain humble when you don't know something
            - Demonstrate genuine concern for customer issues
            - Keep responses concise but thorough

            ## Guidelines
            - Always verify customer information before providing sensitive details
            - If you cannot resolve an issue, offer to connect them with a human representative
            - Document any promises made during the call
            - End calls professionally and ensure customer satisfaction
            ```
          </Step>
        </Steps>
      </Step>

      <Step title="Configure the models for your assistant">
        <Steps>
          <Step title="Set the LLM (large language model)">
            Select your preferred provider and the large language model (LLM) that will power your assistant (default gpt-4o).

            <Frame>
              <img src="../static/images/quickstart/dashboard/set-llm.png" />
            </Frame>
          </Step>

          <Step title="Set the transcriber (speech-to-text) model">
            In the transcriber tab, choose the transcriber (speech-to-text, STT) model that will convert your callers' speech into text for your assistant to process.

            <Frame>
              <img src="../static/images/quickstart/dashboard/set-transcriber.png" />
            </Frame>

            <Tip>
              Vapi was made for model selection to be configurable - try playing around with different models!
            </Tip>
          </Step>

          <Step title="Choose the voice (text-to-speech) model">
            In the voice tab, select the voice (TTS) model that will determine how your assistant sounds to callers.
            
            <Frame>
              <img src="../static/images/quickstart/dashboard/set-voice.png" />
            </Frame>

            Just like with the transcriber, you can plug in any provider!

## Make an outbound call (assistant calls you)

  <Tab title="Dashboard">
    <Steps>
      <Step title="Set up outbound call configuration">
        1. Fill out **your own phone number** as the number to dial.
        2. Set the assistant that will be making the call

        When you click on the outbound call button, your assistant will make an outbound call to the phone number. 
        
        <Tip>
          Your assistant won't yet be able to hang-up the phone at the end of the call.
          You will learn more about configuring call end behaviour in later guides.

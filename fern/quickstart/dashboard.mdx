## Overview

Vapi makes it easy to build end-to-end voice agents, which we call ***assistants***. Assistants support live, two-way conversations. You can call an assistant or have it call you. 

**Each assistant has three components:** Speech-to-text (STT), Language model (LLM) and Text-to-speech (TTS). Vapi gives you full control over each, with dozens of providers and models to choose from.

**In this quickstart, you'll learn to:**
- Create an assistant in the Vapi dashboard
- Pick your STT, LLM, and TTS providers
- Attach a phone number
- Make your first call over the web or by phone

## Prerequisites

- [A Vapi account](https://dashboard.vapi.ai)

## Get started by creating an assistant

<Steps>
  <Step title="Open the Vapi Dashboard">
    Go to [dashboard.vapi.ai](https://dashboard.vapi.ai) and log in to your account.
  </Step>

  <Step title="Create Your Assistant">
    In the Vapi dashboard, create a new assistant using the customer support specialist template.

    </Frame>
  </Step>

  <Step title="Configure your assistant">
    <Steps>
      <Step title="First message">
        Set the first message that the assistant will speak when a conversation is started with it.

        ```plaintext First message
        Hi there, this is Alex from TechSolutions customer support. How can I help you today?
        ```
      </Step>

      <Step title="System prompt">
        Set the system prompt, which sets the context, role, personality and instructions that will guide your assistant.

        ```plaintext System Prompt
        You are Alex, a customer service voice assistant for TechSolutions. Your primary purpose is to help customers resolve issues with their products, answer questions about services, and ensure a satisfying support experience.
        - Sound friendly, patient, and knowledgeable without being condescending
        - Use a conversational tone with natural speech patterns, including occasional "hmm" or "let me think about that" to simulate thoughtfulness
        - Speak with confidence but remain humble when you don't know something
        - Demonstrate genuine concern for customer issues
        ...
        ```
      </Step>
    </Steps>
  </Step>

  <Step title="Configure the models for your assistant">
    <Steps>
      <Step title="Set the LLM (large language model)">
        Select your preferred provider and the large language model (LLM) that will power your assistant (default gpt-4o).

        </Frame>
      </Step>

      <Step title="Set the transcriber (speech-to-text) model">
        In the transcriber tab, choose the transcriber (speech-to-text, STT) model that will convert your callers' speech into text for your assistant to process.

        </Frame>

        <Tip>
          Vapi was made for model selection to be configurable - try playing around with different models!
        </Tip>
      </Step>

      <Step title="Choose the voice (text-to-speech) model">
        In the voice tab, select the voice (TTS) model that will determine how your assistant sounds to callers.
        
        <Frame>
          <img src="../static/images/quickstart/dashboard/set-voice.png" />
        </Frame>

        Just like with the transcriber, you can plug in any provider!

        </Frame>
      </Step>
      <Step title="Attach a phone number to your assistant">
        Select your assistant in the inbound settings for your phone number. Whenever this number is called, your assistant will pick up and have a conversation with them!

## Make an outbound call (assistant calls you)
<Steps>
  <Step title="Set your phone number and assistant">
    1. Fill out <strong>your own phone number</strong> as the number to dial.
    2. Set the assistant that will be making the call

    </Frame>
  </Step>
  <Step title="Make the outbound call">
    When you click on the outbound call button, your assistant will make an outbound call to the phone number. 
    <Tip>
      Your assistant won't yet be able to hang-up the phone at the end of the call.
      You will learn more about configuring call end behaviour in later guides.

## Overview

This guide shows you how to integrate live, two-way voice calls with your Vapi assistant into any web app. You can use Vapi in plain JavaScript, React, Next.js, or any other web framework. 

Get started with either the Vapi web SDK or by connecting to an assistant you created in the dashboard.

<Note>See the full next.js [demo here on v0](https://v0.dev/chat/vapi-quickstart-nextjs-z3lv02T7Dd5). To try it live and make edits, follow these steps:</Note>

1. Fork the app in v0
2. Go to settings --> environment variables 
3. Create a new environment variable called `NEXT_PUBLIC_VAPI_API_KEY`
4. Add your [public api key from the dashboard](https://dashboard.vapi.ai/org/api-keys)!

      <Step title="Create an assistant">
        Create an assistant object.

        ```javascript
        const assistantOptions = {
          name: "Vapi's Pizza Front Desk",
          firstMessage: "Vapi's Pizzeria speaking, how can I help you?",
          transcriber: {
            provider: "deepgram",
            model: "nova-2",
            language: "en-US",
          },
          voice: {
            provider: "playht",
            voiceId: "jennifer",
          },
          model: {
            provider: "openai",
            model: "gpt-4",
            messages: [
              {
                role: "system",
                content: `You are a voice assistant for Vappy's Pizzeria, a pizza shop located on the Internet.\n\nYour job is to take the order of customers calling in. The menu has only 3 types of items: pizza, sides, and drinks. There are no other types of items on the menu.\n\n1) There are 3 kinds of pizza: cheese pizza, pepperoni pizza, and vegetarian pizza (often called \"veggie\" pizza).\n2) There are 3 kinds of sides: french fries, garlic bread, and chicken wings.\n3) There are 2 kinds of drinks: soda, and water. (if a customer asks for a brand name like \"coca cola\", just let them know that we only offer \"soda\")\n\nCustomers can only order 1 of each item. If a customer tries to order more than 1 item within each category, politely inform them that only 1 item per category may be ordered.\n\nCustomers must order 1 item from at least 1 category to have a complete order. They can order just a pizza, or just a side, or just a drink.\n\nBe sure to introduce the menu items, don't assume that the caller knows what is on the menu (most appropriate at the start of the conversation).\n\nIf the customer goes off-topic or off-track and talks about anything but the process of ordering, politely steer the conversation back to collecting their order.\n\nOnce you have all the information you need pertaining to their order, you can end the conversation. You can say something like \"Awesome, we'll have that ready for you in 10-20 minutes.\" to naturally let the customer know the order has been fully communicated.\n\nIt is important that you collect the order in an efficient manner (succinct replies & direct questions). You only have 1 task here, and it is to collect the customers order, then end the conversation.\n\n- Be sure to be kind of funny and witty!\n- Keep all your responses short and simple. Use casual language, phrases like \"Umm...\", \"Well...\", and \"I mean\" are preferred.\n- This is a voice conversation, so keep your responses short, like in a real conversation. Don't ramble for too long.`,
              },
            ],
          },
        };
        ```

        **Parameters:**
        - `name` sets the display name for the assistant (internal use)
        - `firstMessage` is the first message the assistant says
        - `transcriber` selects the speech-to-text provider and model
        - `voice` selects the text-to-speech provider and voice
        - `model` sets the LLM provider, model, and system prompt
      </Step>
      <Step title="Make a call">
        Start a call using your assistant configuration.

        ```javascript
        vapi.start(assistantOptions);
        ```

      <Step title="Create an assistant in the dashboard">
        To create an assistant in the dashboard, follow the step-by-step guide in the [Dashboard Quickstart](https://docs.vapi.ai/quickstart/dashboard#get-started).
      </Step>
      <Step title="Make a call with your assistant">
        Once you have your assistant's ID, you can start a call with it:

        <Frame background="subtle">
          <img src="/static/images/quickstart/assistant-id-dashboard.png" alt="Assistant ID in dashboard" />
        </Frame>

        ```javascript
        vapi.start("YOUR_ASSISTANT_ID_FROM_THE_DASHBOARD");
        ```
      </Step>
      <Step title="Override assistant settings">
        To override assistant settings or set template variables, pass an `assistantOverrides` object as the second argument.

        ```javascript
        const assistantOverrides = {
          transcriber: {
            provider: "deepgram",
            model: "nova-2",
            language: "en-US",
          },
          recordingEnabled: false,
          variableValues: {
            name: "John",
          },
        };

        vapi.start("YOUR_ASSISTANT_ID_FROM_THE_DASHBOARD", assistantOverrides);
        ```
      </Step>
    </Steps>

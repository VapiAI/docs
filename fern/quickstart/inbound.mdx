An inbound call is a phone call that comes **"in"** towards a phone number, & in our case, our AI assistant will be there to pick up the phone call.

There are **4 steps** we will cover to handle our first inbound phone call:

1. **Create an Assistant:** we will create an [assistant](/assistants) & instruct it on how to conduct the call
2. **Get a Phone Number:** we can either import existing numbers we own, or purchase one through Vapi
3. **Attach Our Assistant:** we will put our assistant behind the phone number to pick up calls
4. **Call the Number:** we can then call the number & talk to our assistant

## Vapi’s Pizzeria

We will be implementing a simple order-taking assistant that receives customer calls at a pizza shop called “Vapi’s Pizzeria”.

Vapi’s has 3 types of menu items: `pizza`, `side`s, & `drink`s. Customers will be ordering 1 of each.

## Assistant Setup

First we're going to set up our assistant in the dashboard. Once our assistant’s **transcriber**, **model**, & **voice** are set up, we can call it to place our order.

<Info>
  You can visit your dashboard by going to
  [dashboard.vapi.ai](https://dashboard.vapi.ai)

## Get a Phone Number

Now that we've configured how our assistant will behave, we want to figure out how to call it. We will need a phone number that we can make phone calls to.

## Attach Your Assistant

Now that we have a configured assistant & a phone number, we will put our assistant behind the phone number to pick up incoming phone calls.

In the `Inbound` area of the phone number detail view, select your assistant in the dropdown under `Assistant`.

## Call the Number

You can now make a phone call to the number. Your assistant will pick up the phone & manage the order-taking conversation. Happy ordering!

<Tip>
  Your assistant won't yet be able to hang-up the phone at the end of the call.
  We will learn more about configuring call end behaviour in later guides.

## What is Vapi?

Vapi is the developer platform for building voice AI agents. We handle the complex infrastructure so you can focus on creating great voice experiences.

**Voice agents** allow you to:
- Have natural conversations with users
- Make and receive phone calls
- Integrate with your existing systems and APIs
- Handle complex workflows like appointment scheduling, customer support, and more

## How voice agents work

Every Vapi assistant combines three core technologies:

  <Card title="Speech-to-Text" icon="microphone" iconType="solid">
    Converts user speech into text that your agent can understand
  </Card>
  <Card title="Large Language Model" icon="brain" iconType="solid">
    Processes the conversation and generates intelligent responses
  </Card>
  <Card title="Text-to-Speech" icon="volume-high" iconType="solid">
    Converts your agent's responses back into natural speech
  </Card>
</CardGroup>

You have full control over each component, with dozens of providers and models to choose from; OpenAI, Anthropic, Google, Deepgram, ElevenLabs, and many, many more.

## Two ways to build voice agents

Vapi offers two main primitives for building voice agents, each designed for different use cases:

  <Card 
    title="Assistants" 
    icon="robot" 
    iconType="solid"
    href="/assistants/dynamic-variables"
  >
    **Best for:** Quick kickstart and straightforward conversations
    
    Assistants use a single system prompt to control behavior. Perfect for:
    - Customer support chatbots
    - Simple question-answering agents
    - Getting started quickly with minimal setup
    
    *Control everything from one place with natural language instructions.*
  </Card>
  <Card 
    title="Workflows" 
    icon="diagram-project" 
    iconType="solid"
    href="/workflows/quickstart"
  >
    **Best for:** Complex logic and multi-step processes
    
    Workflows use visual decision trees and conditional logic. Perfect for:
    - Appointment scheduling with availability checks
    - Lead qualification with branching questions
    - Complex customer service flows with escalation paths
    
    *Build sophisticated branching logic without code.*
  </Card>
</CardGroup>

## Key capabilities

- **Real-time conversations:** Sub-600ms response times with natural turn-taking
- **Phone integration:** Make and receive calls on any phone number
- **Web integration:** Embed voice calls directly in your applications  
- **Tool integration:** Connect to your APIs, databases, and existing systems
- **Custom workflows:** Build complex multi-step processes with decision trees

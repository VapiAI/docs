## What is Vapi?

Vapi is the developer platform for building voice AI agents. We handle the complex infrastructure so you can focus on creating great voice experiences.

**Voice agents** allow you to:
- Have natural conversations with users
- Make and receive phone calls
- Integrate with your existing systems and APIs
- Handle complex workflows like appointment scheduling, customer support, and more

## How voice agents work

Every Vapi assistant combines three core technologies:

<CardGroup cols={3}>
  <Card title="Speech-to-Text" icon="microphone" iconType="solid">
    Converts user speech into text that your agent can understand
  </Card>
  <Card title="Large Language Model" icon="brain" iconType="solid">
    Processes the conversation and generates intelligent responses
  </Card>
  <Card title="Text-to-Speech" icon="volume-high" iconType="solid">
    Converts your agent's responses back into natural speech
  </Card>
</CardGroup>

You have full control over each component, with dozens of providers and models to choose from; OpenAI, Anthropic, Google, Deepgram, ElevenLabs, and many, many more.

## Two ways to build voice agents

Vapi offers two main primitives, designed for different use cases:

  <Card 
    title="Assistants" 
    icon="robot" 
    iconType="solid"
    href="/assistants/quickstart"
  >
    <div className='absolute top-4 right-4'>
      <Icon icon="arrow-up-right-from-square" />
    </div>
    **Best for:** Most use cases and fast iteration
    <br />
    Assistants use a single system prompt plus tools and structured outputs. Perfect for:
    - Customer support
    - Lead qualification
    - Booking and routing
  </Card>
  <Card 
    title="Squads" 
    icon="users" 
    iconType="solid"
    href="/squads"
  >
    <div className='absolute top-4 right-4'>
      <Icon icon="arrow-up-right-from-square" />
    </div>
    **Best for:** Multi-assistant setups with specialization
    <br />
    Squads orchestrate multiple assistants with context-preserving transfers. Ideal for:
    - Medical triage and scheduling
    - E‑commerce orders, returns, VIP
    - Property management routing
  </Card>
</CardGroup>

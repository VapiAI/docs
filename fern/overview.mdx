title: Introduction to Vapi
subtitle: The developer platform for building voice AI agents
slug: overview
---

Vapi lets you build, test and deploy real-time voice agents. It handles the underlying infrastructure stack to your agents, making building and scaling agents as easy as possible. 

## Key capabilities
- **Conversational flow:** Turn-taking, interruptions and backchanneling
- **Low latency:** sub-600ms between turns
- **Programmable logic:** Tool calls, workflows, MCP client and server
- **Telephony and streaming:** SIP and browser calls
- **Observability:** transcripts, call metadata, logs

Vapi began as a product build on top of voice agents. After running into the complexity of managing all of the above, real-time and at scale, we built the infrastructure we wished existed — and made it available to other developers.

## What is a Voice Agent? 

We call them ***Assistants***, and they are composed of 3 parts: 


<CardGroup cols={3}>
  <Card title="Speech-To-Text (STT)">
    Audio from the user is transcribed. 
  </Card>
  <Card title="Large Language Model (LLM)">
    Transcript is fed to an LLM. 
  </Card>
  <Card title="Text-To-Speech (TTS)">
    Outputs from the LLM are spoken back ot the user.
  </Card>
</CardGroup>

Each layer is highly customizable and we support dozens of models across STT, LLM and TTS.

**Removed `async` Property from Tool Schemas**: Developers no longer need to set the `async` property when using various tool schemas like `GhlTool`, `SmsTool`, `BashTool`, and others. These tools now operate synchronously by default; please update your code to remove any references to `async` in these schemas.

**Default Roles in Message Schemas**: The `role` property in `ToolMessage`, `AssistantMessage`, and `DeveloperMessage` now has default values of `"tool"`, `"assistant"`, and `"developer"`, respectively. You can omit the `role` field when creating these messages, simplifying message construction.

**Improved Descriptions for Chat Inputs and Messages**: The `input` and `messages` properties in the `Chat`, `CreateChatDTO`, and `OpenAIResponsesRequest` schemas now have clearer descriptions. This helps you understand that `input` can be a string or an array of chat messages, and `messages` provide context for multi-turn conversations.

**Clarified `async` Behavior in `FunctionTool`**: The `async` property's description in `FunctionTool` and related schemas has been updated for clarity. It now better explains how setting `async` to `true` or `false` affects the assistant's behavior, facilitating more effective use of this feature.

**Added Titles to Schema Definitions**: The `oneOf` definitions in the `input` property of `Chat`, `CreateChatDTO`, and `OpenAIResponsesRequest` now include `title` attributes like `"String"` and `"MessageArray"`. This improves schema documentation and assists tools in processing these definitions.

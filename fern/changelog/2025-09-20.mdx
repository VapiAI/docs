# Chat Transport & SMS Integration

1. **Twilio SMS Transport**: Send chat responses directly via SMS using [`TwilioSMSChatTransport`](https://api.vapi.ai/api#:~:text=TwilioSMSChatTransport) in [`CreateChatDTO.transport`](https://api.vapi.ai/api#:~:text=CreateChatDTO.transport). This enables programmatic SMS conversations with your voice assistants, bridging the gap between voice and text communication.

2. **SMS Session Management**: Create new sessions automatically when using SMS transport by providing:
    - `customer`: Customer information for SMS delivery
    - `phoneNumberId`: SMS-enabled phone number from your organization
    - Automatic session creation when both fields are provided

3. **LLM-Generated vs Direct SMS**: Control message processing with [`TwilioSMSChatTransport.useLLMGeneratedMessageForOutbound`](https://api.vapi.ai/api#:~:text=TwilioSMSChatTransport.useLLMGeneratedMessageForOutbound):
    - `true` (default): Input processed by assistant for intelligent responses
    - `false`: Direct message forwarding without LLM processing for notifications and alerts

4. **Enhanced Chat Creation**: [`CreateChatDTO`](https://api.vapi.ai/api#:~:text=CreateChatDTO) now supports sophisticated session management:
    - `transport`: SMS delivery configuration
    - `sessionId`: Use existing session data
    - Mutual exclusivity between `sessionId` and transport fields for clear session boundaries

5. **OpenAI Responses Integration**: Streamlined chat processing with [`OpenAIResponsesRequest`](https://api.vapi.ai/api#:~:text=OpenAIResponsesRequest) supporting the same transport and squad integration features for consistent API experience.

6. **Cross-Platform Continuity**: Seamlessly transition between voice calls and SMS conversations within the same session, maintaining context and conversation history across communication channels.

<Info>
    SMS transport requires SMS-enabled phone numbers in your organization. The phone number must support SMS functionality and belong to your account for successful message delivery.

1. **TestSuiteRunTestAttempt now accepts `callId` and `metadata`**: You can now include a `callId` and `metadata` when creating a test suite run attempt, allowing you to reference calls by ID and attach session-related information.

2. **`call` property in [TestSuiteRunTestAttempt](https://api.vapi.ai/api#:~:text=TestSuiteRunTestAttemptMetadata) is no longer required**: It's now optional to include the full `call` object in a test attempt, providing flexibility for cases where call details are unnecessary or already known.

3. **Attach Metadata to Test Suite Run Attempts**: You can now attach [metadata](https://api.vapi.ai/api#:~:text=TestSuiteRunTestAttemptMetadata) like `sessionId` to test attempts for better tracking and analysis.

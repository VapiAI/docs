1. **Per-Voice Caching Control Added**: Developers can now enable or disable voice caching for each assistant's voice using the new `cachingEnabled` property in voice configurations. This allows you to optimize performance or comply with data policies by controlling whether voice responses are cached.

2. **'Condition' Value Now Accepts Strings**: When specifying conditions, the `value` property should now be provided as a string instead of an object. This simplifies condition definitions and makes it easier to set and interpret condition values.

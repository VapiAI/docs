1. **Customize Server Messages with Flexible Array Input**: Before, [`serverMessages`](https://api.vapi.ai/api#:~:text=ServerMessage) could only be one of a set list of string values (enforced by enum). Now, `serverMessages` is an array of objects with no restrictions on what those objects are as long as they match the [`ServerMessage`](https://api.vapi.ai/api#:~:text=ServerMessage) schema, making the schema more open and future-proof, though less strict. 

We provide an example list that matches the previous values: `["conversation-update", "end-of-call-report", "function-call", "hang", "speech-update", "status-update", "tool-calls", "transfer-destination-request", "user-interrupted"]`.

<Info>
You now need to include the `serverMessages` property when creating or updating an assistant, ensuring you explicitly define which messages your assistant sends to your server.

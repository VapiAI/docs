1. **Removal of `language` Property in Voice Settings**: The `language` property has been removed from the `VapiVoice` and `FallbackVapiVoice` configurations. You no longer need to set `language` when configuring voice settings; voice language may now be handled automatically or through a different configuration.

2. **Introduction of Detailed Node Artifacts**: A new `NodeArtifact` schema has been added, accessible via `call.artifact.nodes`, providing detailed information about each node in a call's workflow. You can now access messages, node names, and variables for each node to gain deeper insights into call executions.

3. **Addition of `nodes` and `variables` to Call Artifacts**:
 The `Artifact` schema now includes `nodes` and `variables` properties, enhancing the data available in `call.artifact`. This allows you to retrieve the history of executed workflow nodes and the final state of variables after a call.

4. **Removal of `Metrics` Schema**: The `Metrics` schema has been completely removed. If your application relies on `Metrics`, you will need to update your code to accommodate this change and explore alternative solutions.

5. **Update Voice Configuration Paths**: With the changes to voice configurations, paths like `assistant.voice` and `call.squad.members.assistant.voice` may require updates. Ensure your configurations align with the new schema definitions and remove any references to the deprecated `language` property.

6. **Enable Recording in Artifacts**: To access call recordings in your artifacts, set `assistant.artifactPlan.recordingEnabled` in your configuration. This enables the `recording` property in `call.artifact`, allowing you to review call recordings for analysis or debugging.

1. **New API Request Tool (`apiRequest`):** Developers can now create custom API request tools using the `apiRequest` tool type, allowing assistants to make HTTP requests to specified URLs.

2. **'TextEditor' Tool Type Renamed:** The `type` value for the Text Editor tool has changed from `text-editor` to `textEditor`. Update your code to use `textEditor` when specifying this tool type.

3. **Enhanced Call Entry Points Descriptions:** The properties related to starting calls with assistants, squads, or workflows have updated descriptions, providing clearer guidance on how to use `assistant`, `assistantId`, `squad`, `squadId`, `workflow`, and `workflowId`.

4. **Extended Server Timeout Limit:** The maximum value for `timeoutSeconds` in server configurations has increased from 120 to 300 seconds, allowing server requests to take up to 5 minutes.

5. **Removal of `secret` Property in Server Schema:** The `secret` property has been removed from the `Server` schema. Adjust your server configurations by removing any references to `server.secret`.

6. **New Voice Option `Kylie`:** The voice ID `Kylie` is now available for use in `VapiVoice` and `FallbackVapiVoice`, providing an additional voice option for your assistants.

7. **Workflows in Server Message Responses:** You can now specify `workflow` and `workflowId` in `ServerMessageResponseAssistantRequest`, enabling the use of workflows when responding to server messages.

8. **`assistantId` No Longer Nullable:** The `assistantId` property in `ServerMessageResponseAssistantRequest` is no longer nullable, which may require you to always provide an `assistantId` or adjust your logic accordingly.

9. **Pattern Constraint on Variable Titles:** The `VariableExtractionSchema` now includes a regex pattern for `title`, restricting it to letters, numbers, and underscores. Ensure your variable titles conform to this pattern.

10. **Updated Server Property Descriptions:** Descriptions for `url`, `headers`, `backoffPlan`, and `timeoutSeconds` in the `Server` schema have been updated for clarity, helping you better understand their purposes and how to configure them.

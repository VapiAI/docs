1. **Simplified `transport` property in `Call` configuration**: You should now configure the `transport` property in [`Call`](https://api.vapi.ai/api#:~:text=Call) as an object when creating or updating a [`Call`](https://api.vapi.ai/api#:~:text=Call), since the separate `Transport` schema has been deprecated. This simplification makes it easier to work with transport details without referencing a separate transport configuration.

<Warning>
    The `Transport` schema is now deprecated and will be removed in a future release.
</Warning>

2. **New call type `vapi.websocketCall`**: You can now make [phone calls over WebSockets](https://docs.vapi.ai/calls/websocket-transport) with Vapi. The `Call` schema now supports a new `type` value: `vapi.websocketCall`.

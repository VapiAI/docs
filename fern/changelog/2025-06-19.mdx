# Workflow Configuration Enhancements and Assistant Updates

1. **Workflow-Level Configuration of Voice and Plans**: Developers can now configure `voice`, `transcriber`, and various plans like `monitorPlan` and `artifactPlan` at the workflow level. These configurations can still be overridden at the node level if needed. 

2. **Use of Dynamic Credentials in Workflows**: Workflows now support `credentials` and `credentialIds`, allowing you to specify dynamic credentials for workflow calls. This offers more flexibility in credential management, enabling credentials to be tied directly to specific workflows.

3. **`backgroundDenoisingEnabled` Deprecated in Assistants**: The `backgroundDenoisingEnabled` property in Assistant is now deprecated. You should use the new [`Assistant.backgroundSpeechDenoisingPlan`](https://api.vapi.ai/api#:~:text=SessionPaginatedResponse-,Assistant,-AssistantPaginatedResponse) to configure advanced background noise and speech denoising features.

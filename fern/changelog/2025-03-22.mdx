1. **Customizable Background Sound**: You can now use a custom audio file as the background sound in calls by providing a URL in the `backgroundSound` property. This allows you to enhance the call experience with personalized ambient sounds or music.

2. **New Recording Format Options in `ArtifactPlan`**: You can specify the recording format as either `'wav;l16'` or `'mp3'` in `Assistant.artifactPlan` or `Call.artifactPlan`. This gives you control over the audio format of call recordings to suit your storage and playback preferences.

3. **Integrate with Langfuse for Enhanced Observability**: You can now integrate with Langfuse by setting `assistant.observabilityPlan` to `langfuse`. Add `tags` and `metadata` to your traces to improve monitoring, categorization, and debugging of your application's behavior.

1. **Workflows Now Marked as Beta Features**: The workflow endpoints and related properties have now moved to **[BETA]**, indicating they're slightly more stable but still in active development. Refer to the [Workflows documentation](https://docs.vapi.ai/workflows) and [API documentation](https://docs.vapi.ai/api-reference/calls/list#:~:text=Workflow) for more information.

2. **New `{{endedReason}}` Variable in Templates**: You can now include the `{{endedReason}}` variable in your post-call analysis templates to access why a call ended. This helps generate more insightful summaries and evaluations based on the call's outcome.

3. **Introduction of `SayAssistantHookAction` Schema**: A new action, [`SayAssistantHookAction`](https://api.vapi.ai/api#:~:text=SayAssistantHookAction), allows the assistant to say specific messages during calls. Use this by adding it to `call.squad.members.assistant.hooks.do[type=say]` to enhance call interactions.

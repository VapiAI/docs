1. **Introducing `SmsSendTool` for SMS messaging support**: You can now create and manage tools of type `sms` using the new [SMS Send Tool](https://api.vapi.ai/api#:~:text=SmsSendTool), allowing you to send SMS messages via defined servers. The `sms` tool type is also now recognized in API endpoints, ensuring that SMS send tools are correctly processed during CRUD operations.

2. **New configuration options for voice and transcriber settings**: The `autoMode` property has been added to [Eleven Labs Voice Settings](https://api.vapi.ai/api#:~:text=ElevenLabsVoice), letting developers control automatic voice settings. Additionally, `confidenceThreshold` has been introduced in transcriber settings, allowing developers to set thresholds to discard low-confidence transcriptions and improve accuracy.

3. **Enhanced speed control in `CartesiaExperimentalControls`**: The `speed` property now accepts both predefined speeds (`'slowest'`, `'slow'`, `'normal'`, `'fast'`, `'fastest'`) and numeric values between -1 and 1. This gives you more precise control over speed settings for better customization.

1. **New Chat and Session API Endpoints**: You can now manage chats and sessions using the new API endpoints `/chat`, `/chat/{id}`, `/chat/responses`, `/session`, and `/session/{id}`. This enables you to programmatically create, retrieve, and manage chat conversations and sessions within your applications.

2. **Variable Extraction Feature Removed**: The variable extraction functionality has been removed from the API. You'll need to update your workflows if you previously used variable extraction, as it is no longer supported.

3. **Specify Regions for OpenAI Models**: You can now specify the region for OpenAI models in `OpenAIModel` and `WorkflowOpenAIModel` by including a region in the `model` property, like `gpt-4.1-2025-04-14:westus`. This helps you comply with data residency rules or regional requirements by ensuring data processing occurs in specified locations.

4. **New OpenAI Models Added**: A range of new OpenAI models, including regional variants, are now available for use. You can choose these new models to better align with your application's performance needs and regional compliance requirements.

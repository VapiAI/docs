# Squad Management & Session Enhancement

1. **Squad-Based Sessions**: Organize your assistants into collaborative teams with [`Session.squad`](https://api.vapi.ai/api#:~:text=Session.squad) and [`Session.squadId`](https://api.vapi.ai/api#:~:text=Session.squadId). Sessions can now be associated with squads for team-based conversation management and coordinated assistant behavior.

2. **Squad Chat Integration**: Enable squad-based chat conversations using [`Chat.squad`](https://api.vapi.ai/api#:~:text=Chat.squad) and [`Chat.squadId`](https://api.vapi.ai/api#:~:text=Chat.squadId). This allows multiple assistants to participate in or be aware of chat contexts for more sophisticated conversation handling.

3. **Enhanced Session Creation**: Create squad-enabled sessions with [`CreateSessionDTO.squad`](https://api.vapi.ai/api#:~:text=CreateSessionDTO.squad) and [`CreateSessionDTO.squadId`](https://api.vapi.ai/api#:~:text=CreateSessionDTO.squadId), enabling persistent conversation contexts across multiple assistants and interaction types.

4. **Chat Management by Squad**: Filter and organize chats by squad membership using [`GetChatPaginatedDTO.squadId`](https://api.vapi.ai/api#:~:text=GetChatPaginatedDTO.squadId) for better conversation management and team-based analytics.

5. **Session Management by Squad**: Query sessions by squad association with [`GetSessionPaginatedDTO.squadId`](https://api.vapi.ai/api#:~:text=GetSessionPaginatedDTO.squadId), providing team-based session organization and management capabilities.

6. **Full Message History**: Control conversation context retention with [`ArtifactPlan.fullMessageHistoryEnabled`](https://api.vapi.ai/api#:~:text=ArtifactPlan.fullMessageHistoryEnabled). When enabled, artifacts contain complete message history even after handoff context engineering, preserving full conversation flow for analysis.

7. **Transfer Records**: Track warm transfer details with [`Artifact.transfers`](https://api.vapi.ai/api#:~:text=Artifact.transfers), providing comprehensive records of transfer destinations, transcripts, and status information for multi-assistant conversations.

    Squad management enables sophisticated multi-assistant workflows where different specialists can handle different parts of a conversation while maintaining shared context and coordination.

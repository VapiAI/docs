# Breaking Changes & API Cleanup

1. **Legacy Endpoint Removal**: The following deprecated endpoints have been removed as part of our API modernization effort:
    - `/logs` - Use call artifacts and monitoring instead
    - `/workflow/{id}` - Access workflows through the main workflow endpoints
    - `/test-suite` and related paths - Replaced by the new evaluation system
    - `/knowledge-base` and related paths - Integrated into model configurations

2. **Knowledge Base Architecture Change**: The `knowledgeBaseId` property has been removed from all model configurations. This affects:
    - [`XaiModel`](https://api.vapi.ai/api#:~:text=XaiModel), [`GroqModel`](https://api.vapi.ai/api#:~:text=GroqModel), [`GoogleModel`](https://api.vapi.ai/api#:~:text=GoogleModel)
    - [`OpenAIModel`](https://api.vapi.ai/api#:~:text=OpenAIModel), [`AnthropicModel`](https://api.vapi.ai/api#:~:text=AnthropicModel), [`CustomLLMModel`](https://api.vapi.ai/api#:~:text=CustomLLMModel)
    - All other model provider configurations

3. **Transcriber Property Deprecation**: [`AssemblyAITranscriber.wordFinalizationMaxWaitTime`](https://api.vapi.ai/api#:~:text=AssemblyAITranscriber.wordFinalizationMaxWaitTime) and [`FallbackAssemblyAITranscriber.wordFinalizationMaxWaitTime`](https://api.vapi.ai/api#:~:text=FallbackAssemblyAITranscriber.wordFinalizationMaxWaitTime) are now deprecated:
    - Use smart endpointing plans for better speech timing control
    - More precise conversation flow management
    - Enhanced end-of-turn detection capabilities

4. **Schema Path Cleanup**: Removed numerous unused schema paths from model configurations to simplify the API structure and improve performance. This cleanup affects internal schema references but doesn't impact your existing integrations.

5. **New v2 API**: We are introducing a new API version v2. These changes are part of our ongoing effort to:
    - Simplify the API structure for better developer experience
    - Remove redundant and deprecated functionality
    - Complete the transition to new evaluation and compliance systems
    - Improve API performance and maintainability

For details on the new features that replace these deprecated endpoints, see our recent changelog entries:
- [Enhanced Authentication & Custom Credentials (Aug 30)](./2025-08-30.mdx)
- [Recording Consent & Compliance Management (Sep 2)](./2025-09-02.mdx)
- [Evaluation System Foundation (Sep 5)](./2025-09-05.mdx)
- [Evaluation Execution & Results Processing (Sep 28)](./2025-09-28.mdx)

<Warning>
    If you're currently using any of the removed endpoints or properties, you must migrate to the new alternatives before this release. Contact support if you need assistance with migration strategies.

## Removed Endpoints
The following endpoints are no longer available:
- `GET /logs` - Use call artifacts instead
- `GET /workflow/{id}` - Use main workflow endpoints
- `GET /test-suite`, `POST /test-suite` - Use [evaluation endpoints](./2025-09-05.mdx)
- `GET /test-suite/{id}`, `PUT /test-suite/{id}`, `DELETE /test-suite/{id}` - Use [evaluation management](./2025-09-28.mdx)
- `POST /test-suite/{testSuiteId}/run` - Use [evaluation runs](./2025-09-28.mdx)
- `GET /knowledge-base`, `POST /knowledge-base` - Integrated into model configurations
- All related nested endpoints and operations

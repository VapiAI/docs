1. **New Structured Output Endpoints**: You can now use [new APIs for structured outputs](https://docs.vapi.ai/api-reference/calls/list#:~:text=Delete%20Logs-,Structured%20Outputs,-GET) to define, extract, and manage structured data from conversations.

2. **Configure Structured Output Resources**: You can now define reusable structured data extraction templates, including:
  - **Custom JSON Schema**: Specify the exact structure and validation rules for extracted data using full JSON Schema support (objects, arrays, enums, validation constraints, and more).
  - **Model Selection**: Choose the LLM (OpenAI, Anthropic, Google, or custom) for extraction, or provide custom system/user prompts with Liquid templating for advanced scenarios.
  - **Context Linking**: Link structured outputs to specific workflows or assistants for context-aware extraction.
  - **Metadata**: Track creation/update timestamps, org linkage, and provide rich descriptions for each structured output.

3. **Assistant Transfer Improvements**: You can now include an optional `name` property to better identify and manage your transfer assistants.

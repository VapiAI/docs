# Test Suite, Smart Endpointing, and Compliance Plans, Chat Completion Message Workflows, and Voicemail Detection

1. **Test Suite Enhancements**: Developers can now define `targetPlan` and `testerPlan` when creating or updating [test suites](https://api.vapi.ai/api#:~:text=TestSuite), allowing for customized testing configurations without importing phone numbers to Vapi.

2. **Smart Endpointing Updates**: You can now select between [`Vapi`](https://api.vapi.ai/api#:~:text=VapiSmartEndpointingPlan) and [`Livekit`](https://api.vapi.ai/api#:~:text=LivekitSmartEndpointingPlan) smart endpointing providers using the `Assistant.startSpeakingPlan.smartEndpointingPlan`; the `customEndpointingRules` property is deprecated and should no longer be used.

3. **Compliance Plan Enhancements**: Organizations can now specify compliance settings using the new `compliancePlan` property, enabling features like PCI compliance at the org level.

4. **Chat Completion Message Updates**: When working with OpenAI chat completions, you should now use [`ChatCompletionMessageWorkflows`](https://api.vapi.ai/api#:~:text=ChatCompletionMessageWorkflows) instead of the deprecated `ChatCompletionMessage`.

5. **Voicemail Detection Defaults Updated**: The default `voicemailExpectedDurationSeconds` for voicemail detection plans has increased from 15 to 25 seconds, affecting how voicemail detection timings are handled.

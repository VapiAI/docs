1. **Introducing `SmsSendTool` for SMS messaging support**: Developers can now create and manage tools of type `sms` using the new `SmsSendTool` schema, enabling assistants to send SMS messages via defined servers. This allows integration of SMS sending capabilities into applications, enhancing communication options.

2. **`sms` type added to discriminator mappings**: The `sms` tool type is now recognized in API endpoints, ensuring that `SmsSendTool`s are correctly processed during create, read, update, and delete operations. This enables seamless handling of SMS tools within existing API workflows.

3. **New configuration options for voice and transcriber settings**: The `autoMode` property has been added to `ElevenLabsVoice` schemas, letting developers control automatic voice settings. Additionally, `confidenceThreshold` has been introduced in transcriber schemas, allowing developers to set thresholds to discard low-confidence transcriptions and improve accuracy.

4. **Enhanced speed control in `CartesiaExperimentalControls`**: The `speed` property now accepts both predefined speeds (`'slowest'`, `'slow'`, `'normal'`, `'fast'`, `'fastest'`) and numeric values between -1 and 1. This provides developers with more precise control over speed settings for better customization.

1. **Updated Log Endpoints:**
Both the `GET /logs` and `DELETE /logs` endpoints have been simplified by removing the `orgId` parameter.

2. **Updated Log Schema:**
The following fields in the Log schema are no longer required: `requestDurationSeconds`, `requestStartedAt`, `requestFinishedAt`, `requestBody`, `requestHttpMethod`, `requestUrl`, `requestPath`, and `responseHttpCode`.

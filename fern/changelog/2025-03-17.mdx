# New `timeoutSeconds` Property in Custom LLM Model

1. **New `timeoutSeconds` Property in [`Custom LLM Model`](https://api.vapi.ai/api#:~:text=CustomLLMModel):** Developers can now specify a custom timeout duration (between 20 and 600 seconds) for connections to their [custom language model provider](https://api.vapi.ai/api#:~:text=CustomLLMModel) using the new `timeoutSeconds` property. This enhancement allows for better control over response waiting times, accommodating longer operations or varying network conditions.

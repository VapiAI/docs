1. **Minimax Voice Provider Integration and Error Handling**: You can now use [MinimaxVoice](https://api.vapi.ai/api#:~:text=MinimaxVoice) as a voice provider in your [assistants](https://api.vapi.ai/api#:~:text=SessionPaginatedResponse-,Assistant,-AssistantPaginatedResponse) and [workflows](https://api.vapi.ai/api#:~:text=Workflow), with support for [Minimax credentials](https://api.vapi.ai/api#:~:text=CreateMinimaxCredentialDTO) for seamless authentication and integration. Additionally, calls can now terminate with Minimax-specific error reasons such as `pipeline-error-minimax-voice-failed` and `call.in-progress.error-vapifault-minimax-voice-failed`. This gives you access to customizable voice characteristics like pitch, speed, and emotion for more natural-sounding conversations.

2. **AssemblyAI Transcriber Updates**: The [AssemblyAITranscriber](https://api.vapi.ai/api#:~:text=AssemblyAITranscriber) configuration has been simplified:
   - The `enableUniversalStreamingApi` property has been removed.
   - The `formatTurns` property now defaults to `true` and no longer depends on the universal streaming API setting.
   - Several properties have updated descriptions and defaults, with references to the deprecated universal streaming API removed.

3. **Enhanced Chat and Session Events**: New message types have been added for handling chat and session events: `chat.created`, `chat.deleted`, `session.created`, `session.updated`, and `session.deleted`. These events are available in both [ClientMessage](https://api.vapi.ai/api#:~:text=ClientMessage) and [ServerMessage](https://api.vapi.ai/api#:~:text=ServerMessage) objects, giving you better control over interactive conversations.

4. **Expanded API Request Tool Capabilities**: The [ApiRequestTool](https://api.vapi.ai/api#:~:text=ApiRequestTool) now supports `PUT`, `PATCH`, and `DELETE` HTTP methods alongside the existing `GET` and `POST` methods. This enables your tools to perform full CRUD operations on external APIs.

5. **Targeted Call Analysis**: You can now specify `outcomeIds` in your [AnalysisPlan](https://api.vapi.ai/api#:~:text=AnalysisPlan) to calculate specific outcomes during call analysis. This allows for more focused analytics based on your defined metrics and KPIs.

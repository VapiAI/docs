1. **Define Hooks at Workflow Level**: You can now define call-level hooks using `Workflow.hooks` to trigger actions on call events.

2. **New Actions Available in Hooks**: Hooks support new actions like `say`, `tool`, `transfer`, and `function`, providing more options to define what happens when a hook is triggered.

3. **Hooks Triggered by Additional Events**: Hooks can now be set to trigger on new events such as `Call.ending`, `Customer.speech.timeout`, `Customer.speech.interrupted`, and `Assistant.speech.interrupted`, giving you more flexibility in handling different call scenarios. 

4. **Conditional Hook Execution with Filters**: You can use the [`CallHookFilter`](https://api.vapi.ai/api#:~:text=CallHookFilter) to specify conditions under which a hook should trigger, allowing for precise control over hook activation based on call data.

5. **Enhanced Prompt Configuration in Actions**: With [`SayHookAction`](https://api.vapi.ai/api#:~:text=SayHookAction), you can configure prompts as a string or an array of messages, providing flexibility in how messages are delivered to callers.

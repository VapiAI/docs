1. **Introduction of `mcp` Tool Type**: Developers can now create and manage [MCP tools](https://api.vapi.ai/api#:~:text=McpTool), enabling customized interactions with specific tools, prompts, and resources in their applications. The new `mcp` tools can be configured using properties like `async`, `server`, `function`, and `messages` to control their behavior.

2. **Simplification of `Knowledge Base`**: The `model` property in the [`Knowledge Base`](https://api.vapi.ai/api#:~:text=KnowledgeBase) is now optional and changed from an object to a string, simplifying its use. You should update your Assistant configuration to treat `model` as a simple string identifier and adjust accordingly.

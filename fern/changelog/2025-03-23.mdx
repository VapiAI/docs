1. **Multi-Structured Data Extraction with `StructuredDataMultiPlan`:** You can now extract multiple sets of structured data from calls by configuring `assistant.analysisPlan.structuredDataMultiPlan`. This allows you to define various extraction plans, each producing structured outputs accessible via `call.analysis.structuredDataMulti`.

2. **Customizable Voice Speed and Language Settings:** You can now adjust the speech speed and language for your assistant's voice by using the new `speed` and `language` properties in `Assistant.voice`. This enables you to fine-tune the voice output to better match your user's preferences and localize the experience.

3. **Integration of OpenAI Transcriber:** The `transcriber` property in assistants now supports `OpenAITranscriber`, allowing you to utilize OpenAI's transcription services. A corresponding `Call.endedReason` value, `pipeline-error-openai-transcriber-failed`, has been added to help you identify when a call ends due to an OpenAI transcriber error.

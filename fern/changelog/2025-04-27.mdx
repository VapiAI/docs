1. **New Assistant Hook for Call Ending Events**: You can now define actions to execute when a call is ending using [`Assistant.hooks\["AssistantHookCallEnding"\]`](https://api.vapi.ai/api#:~:text=AssistantHookCallEnding). This allows you to specify actions like transferring the call, saying a message, or invoking a function at the end of a call.

2. **Enhanced Voicemail Detection Configuration**: Configure voicemail detection more precisely with new `Assistant.voicemailDetection.backoffPlan` and `Assistant.voicemailDetection.beepMaxAwaitSeconds` properties. This lets you control retry strategies and set maximum wait times for voicemail beeps.

3. **Twilio Authentication Using API Keys**: Authenticate with Twilio using `apiKey` and `apiSecret` when importing a [Twilio Phone Number](https://dashboard.vapi.ai/phone-numbers/) This replaces the need for `authToken`. 

4. **Support for New Voicemail Detection Provider and Model**: Utilize the new `vapi` provider for voicemail detection by configuring `Assistant.voicemailDetection.provider`. Additionally, the `gemini-2.5-flash-preview-04-17` model is now supported in various schemas for advanced capabilities.

5. **Expanded Workflow Nodes**: Workflows now support `Start` and `Assistant` nodes, enabling more complex and customizable call flow designs. This allows for greater flexibility in defining how calls are handled.

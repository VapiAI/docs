1. **Azure Region Renamed to `swedencentral` (from *sweden*)**: Azure Speech Services customers using the Sweden data center should now specify `swedencentral` as your Azure Speech Services region instead of `sweden`.  Update your region in your code and the updated [provider keys page](https://dashboard.vapi.ai/keys) > *Azure Speech*.

1. **Updated `Call.endedReason` with New Prefix** The `endedReason` codes now include a prefix `call.in-progress.error-`, standardizing error codes across schemas. This change requires you to update your code to use the new prefixed enum values when handling call termination reasons.

   The following specific `endedReason` values have been updated:
   
   | Old Value | New Value |
   | --- | --- |
   | `pipeline-no-available-llm-model` | `call.in-progress.error-pipeline-no-available-llm-model` |
   | `assistant-did-not-receive-customer-audio` | `call.in-progress.error-assistant-did-not-receive-customer-audio` |
   | `sip-telephony-provider-failed-to-connect-call` | `call.in-progress.error-sip-telephony-provider-failed-to-connect-call` |

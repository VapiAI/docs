1. **Batch Call Operations**: You can now place multiple calls to different customers at once by providing a list of `customer`s as an array in [`POST /call`](https://api.vapi.ai/api#/Calls/CallController_create).

2. **Google Sheets Row Append Tool Added**: You can now append rows to Google Sheets directly from your assistant using [`GoogleSheetsRowAppendTool`](https://api.vapi.ai/api#/Tools/GoogleSheetsRowAppendTool). This allows integration with Google Sheets via the API for automating data entry tasks.

3. **Call Control and Scheduling**: You can now schedule calls using the new `SchedulePlan` feature, specifying earliest and latest times for calls to occur. This gives you more control over call timing and scheduling.

4. **New Transcriber Options and Fallback Plans**: New transcribers like `GoogleTranscriber` and `OpenAITranscriber` have been added, along with the ability to set `fallbackPlan` for transcribers. This provides more choices and reliability for speech recognition in your applications.

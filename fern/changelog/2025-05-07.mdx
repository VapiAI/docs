1. **`ClientMessage` Additions**: Several new client message schemas have been added with additional information about `call`, `customer`, `assistant`, `timestamp`, and `phoneNumber`. This includes:

- [`Client Message Tool Calls`](https://api.vapi.ai/api#:~:text=ClientMessageToolCalls)
- [`Client Message Transcript`](https://api.vapi.ai/api#:~:text=ClientMessageTranscript)
- [`Client Message Speech Update`](https://api.vapi.ai/api#:~:text=ClientMessageSpeechUpdate)
- [`Client Message Transfer Update`](https://api.vapi.ai/api#:~:text=ClientMessageTransferUpdate)

2. **New Hooks for Speech Interruption Events**: Two new hooks, [`Speech Interrupted Assistant Hook`](https://api.vapi.ai/api#:~:text=AssistantHookAssistantSpeechInterrupted) and [`Speech Interrupted Customer Hook`](https://api.vapi.ai/api#:~:text=AssistantHookCustomerSpeechInterrupted), enable you to define actions when speech is interrupted during a call.

3. **Call Schema Updates**: There are several notable updates to how `Call` is structured:

- `costs` array now includes a new cost type: [`KnowledgeBaseCost`](https://api.vapi.ai/api#:~:text=KnowledgeBaseCost)
- `phoneCallProvider` and `phoneCallProviderId` are now deprecated.
- `waitFunction` in `LivekitSmartEndpointingPlan` has been updated to improve how long the assistant waits before speaking, enhancing call flow responsiveness.

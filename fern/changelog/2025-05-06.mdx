1. **Use Workflows as Call Entry Points**: You can now start calls or configure phone numbers using a `workflow` or `workflowId`, just like you would with `assistant`, `assistantId`, `squad`, or `squadId`. This provides more flexibility in defining how calls are initiated and allows direct use of workflows. Refer to the [Workflows documentation](https://docs.vapi.ai/workflows) and [API documentation](https://docs.vapi.ai/api-reference/calls/list#:~:text=Workflow) for more information.

2. **New Warm Transfer Mode and Hold Music in `TransferPlan`**: There's a new transfer mode `warm-transfer-experimental` in `call.squad.members.assistant.hooks.do[type=transfer].destination.transferPlan`that enhances call transfer capabilities, including voicemail detection and customer hold experience. You can also customize the hold music by specifying a `holdAudioUrl`.

3. **Simplified `clientMessages` Configuration**: The `clientMessages` property has been updated and is now required in `AssistantOverrides`, `CreateAssistantDTO`, and `UpdateAssistantDTO`. This change simplifies how you specify which messages are sent to your Client SDKs.

1. **Renaming `SmsSendTool` to `SmsTool`:** The tool previously known as `SmsSendTool` is now `SmsTool`. You can now use the new `SmsTool` schema to send SMS messages with enhanced configuration options like `async`, `server`, `function`, and `messages`.

2. **Update Text Editor Tool Type to `'text-editor'`:** The `type` for Text Editor tools has changed from `'textEditor'` to `'text-editor'`. Make sure to update your configurations to use `type`: `'text-editor'` when specifying a Text Editor tool.

3. **Removal of `backgroundSound.maxLength` Property:** The `maxLength` constraint has been removed from the `backgroundSound` property in Assistant schemas. You no longer need to limit the length of `backgroundSound`; it can now be of any length.

4. **Deprecation of `MakeTool`:** The `MakeTool` has been removed from the available tools in various model schemas. Please update your models to remove any references to `MakeTool` and use alternative tools as needed.

# Session and Workflow Enhancements

1. **Addition of `expirationSeconds` to Session Schemas**: You can now set custom session expiration times using the `expirationSeconds` property when creating or updating sessions. This allows sessions to expire anywhere between 1 minute and 30 days, providing greater control over session lifecycles.

2. **Introduction of `globalPrompt` in Workflow Schemas**: A new `globalPrompt` property allows you to define a default prompt for entire workflows. By setting a `globalPrompt` up to 5,000 characters, you can streamline your workflow configurations without setting prompts for each individual node.

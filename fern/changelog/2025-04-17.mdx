**1. **Custom Hooks When a Call is Ringing**: You can now define custom hooks on your phone numbers to automatically perform actions when a call is ringing. This enables you to play messages or transfer calls without additional server-side code by using the new `hooks` property in `Call.phoneNumber.hooks["phoneNumberHookCallRinging"]`. 

**2. **Say and Transfer Actions in Hooks**: The new [phone number hook call ringing](https://api.vapi.ai/api#:~:text=PhoneNumberHookCallRinging) allows you to specify actions that trigger when a call is ringing (`on: 'call.ringing'`). like [redirecting calls](https://api.vapi.ai/api#:~:text=TransferPhoneNumberHookAction) or [playing a message](https://api.vapi.ai/api#:~:text=SayPhoneNumberHookAction). Include these actions in the `do` array of your hook.

**3. **Enhanced Call Tracking with endedReason**: When implementing call analytics, you can now track calls that ended due to hook actions through new `endedReason` values: 
- `'call.ringing.hook-executed-say'`: Call ended after playing a message via hook
- `'call.ringing.hook-executed-transfer'`: Call ended after being transferred via hook
These values let you distinguish between different automated call handling outcomes in your reporting.

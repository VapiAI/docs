# Voicemail Detection & Handling Improvements

1. **Enhanced Beep Detection**: Improve voicemail detection accuracy with [`CreateVoicemailToolDTO.beepDetectionEnabled`](https://api.vapi.ai/api#:~:text=CreateVoicemailToolDTO.beepDetectionEnabled) specifically for Twilio-based calls. This feature detects the characteristic beep sound that indicates voicemail recording has started.

2. **Workflow Voicemail Integration**: Configure comprehensive voicemail handling in workflows with enhanced message and detection capabilities:
    - [`Workflow.voicemailMessage`](https://api.vapi.ai/api#:~:text=Workflow.voicemailMessage): Custom messages for voicemail scenarios (up to 1000 characters)
    - [`Workflow.voicemailDetection`](https://api.vapi.ai/api#:~:text=Workflow.voicemailDetection): Configurable detection methods for different providers

3. **Assistant Voicemail Enhancement**: Improved voicemail handling in assistant configurations with [`Assistant.voicemailMessage`](https://api.vapi.ai/api#:~:text=Assistant.voicemailMessage) and [`Assistant.voicemailDetection`](https://api.vapi.ai/api#:~:text=Assistant.voicemailDetection) for consistent behavior across all conversation types.

4. **Multiple Detection Methods**: Choose from various voicemail detection providers:
    - **Google**: [`GoogleVoicemailDetectionPlan`](https://api.vapi.ai/api#:~:text=GoogleVoicemailDetectionPlan) for AI-powered detection
    - **OpenAI**: [`OpenAIVoicemailDetectionPlan`](https://api.vapi.ai/api#:~:text=OpenAIVoicemailDetectionPlan) for intelligent voicemail recognition
    - **Twilio**: [`TwilioVoicemailDetectionPlan`](https://api.vapi.ai/api#:~:text=TwilioVoicemailDetectionPlan) for carrier-level detection
    - **Vapi**: [`VapiVoicemailDetectionPlan`](https://api.vapi.ai/api#:~:text=VapiVoicemailDetectionPlan) for integrated detection

5. **Beep Detection for Call Flows**: The new beep detection capability works specifically with Twilio transport, providing reliable voicemail identification when traditional detection methods may not be sufficient.

6. **Voicemail Tool Configuration**: Enhanced tool rejection and messaging capabilities ensure appropriate handling when voicemail is detected, with configurable responses based on your business requirements.

<Warning>
    Beep detection is currently available only for Twilio-based calls. If you're using other providers, consider combining multiple detection methods for better accuracy.

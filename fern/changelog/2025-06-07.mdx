# New Ended Reasons for SIP Inbound Calls

<Note>
  You can now handle SIP inbound call failures with two new `endedReason` values:
</Note>

- `call.ringing.sip-inbound-caller-hungup-before-call-connect`: Use this when a caller hangs up before the call connects
- `call.ringing.error-sip-inbound-call-failed-to-connect`: Use this when there's a connection error

These values are available in all call event schemas, including `Call`, `ServerMessageStatusUpdate`, and `ServerMessageEndOfCallReport`. Implement precise error handling for your SIP inbound calls by checking for these specific failure scenarios.

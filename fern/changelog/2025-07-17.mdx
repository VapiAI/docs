# Use Transient Tools in Conversation Nodes

1. **Add Transient Tools to Conversation Nodes with `tools`:** You can now define transient tools directly within a [`Conversation Node`](https://api.vapi.ai/api#:~:text=ConversationNode) using `Call.workflow.nodes[type=conversation].tools`. This allows for the customization of tools specific to a conversation without altering global tool configurations.

2. **Incorporate Existing Tools into Conversation Nodes with `toolIds`:** You can now reference existing tools in a [`Conversation Node`](https://api.vapi.ai/api#:~:text=ConversationNode) by listing their IDs using the `toolIds` property. This enables the reuse of predefined tools across different nodes and workflows for consistency and easier maintenance.

This allows you to mix transient, node-specific tools with existing tools within a `ConversationNode`. Learn more about how to use this in the [Conversation Node documentation](https://docs.vapi.ai/workflows/overview#conversation-node).

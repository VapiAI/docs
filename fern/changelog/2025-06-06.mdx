# Workflows Out of Beta and Gladia Transcriptions

1. **Workflows Are Out of Beta**: You can now use workflows in production as we've removed all `[BETA]` labels from workflow-related properties and API endpoints. See [Workflow API Documentation](/docs/api/workflows) for complete details.

2. **Per-Call Workflow Customization with Overrides**: You can now customize workflows on a per-call basis using the new `Call.workflowOverrides` property. Override workflow settings and template variables using [LiquidJS syntax](https://liquidjs.com/tutorials/intro-to-liquid.html). See [Workflow Documentation](/docs/workflows) for details.

3. **Enhanced Gladia Transcriptions**: You can now transcribe audio in multiple languages using the new `languages` property in `GladiaTranscriber` and `FallbackGladiaTranscriber` (when `languageBehaviour` is `manual`). You can also use the new `solaria-1` transcription model for potentially improved results. Learn more in our [Transcription Documentation](/docs/transcription).

1. **Addition of `model` property to Workflows**: You can now set a default language model for your workflows using [`Workflow.model`](https://api.vapi.ai/api#:~:text=TrieveKnowledgeBaseImport-,Workflow,-UpdateWorkflowDTO). This simplifies configuration by allowing you to specify the model once for the entire workflow instead of at each node.

2. **Removal of `westus2` region from Azure credentials**: The `westus2` region is no longer supported in Azure credential configurations. Update your Azure credentials to use a different region to maintain access to Azure services.

<Warning>
  The following OpenAI models have been removed and are no longer available: `gpt-4.5-preview`, `o1-preview`, and `o1-preview-2024-09-12`.  
  Update your workflows to use supported models to avoid interruptions.

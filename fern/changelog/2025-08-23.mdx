# Voicemail Detection Enhancements

1. **Voicemail Detection Enhancements**: You can now configure voicemail detection across providers with [`Assistant.voicemailDetection`](https://api.vapi.ai/api#:~:text=https://api.vapi.ai/api#:~:text=SessionPaginatedResponse-,Assistant,-AssistantPaginatedResponse), for example with [Vapi](https://api.vapi.ai/api#:~:text=VapiVoicemailDetectionPlan), [Google](https://api.vapi.ai/api#:~:text=GoogleVoicemailDetectionPlan), and [OpenAI](https://api.vapi.ai/api#:~:text=OpenAIVoicemailDetectionPlan).Each plan now supports a `type` property to select between:
  - `audio`: Native audio model detection (default)
  - `transcript`: ASR/transcript-based detection

2. **Fine-tuned control**: Under each voicemail detection plan, you can configure backoff plans and beep detection timing with [`Assistant.voicemailDetection["yourVoicemailDetectionPlan"].beepMaxAwaitSeconds`](https://api.vapi.ai/api#:~:text=https://api.vapi.ai/api#:~:text=VapiVoicemailDetectionPlan) for improved voicemail handling in automated calls.

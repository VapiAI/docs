# Advanced Analytics & Variable Grouping

1. **Variable Value Analytics**: Gain deeper insights into your assistant performance with [`AnalyticsQuery.groupByVariableValue`](https://api.vapi.ai/api#:~:text=AnalyticsQuery.groupByVariableValue). Group analytics data by specific variable values extracted during calls for granular performance analysis.

2. **Enhanced Grouping Options**: Use [`VariableValueGroupBy`](https://api.vapi.ai/api#:~:text=VariableValueGroupBy) to specify custom grouping criteria:
    - `key`: The variable value key to group by (up to 100 characters)
    - Combine with existing grouping options like `assistantId`, `endedReason`, and `status`

3. **Multi-Dimensional Analysis**: Create complex analytics queries by combining traditional grouping fields with variable values:
    - Group by assistant performance AND custom business metrics
    - Analyze conversation outcomes by extracted data points
    - Track success rates across different variable value segments

4. **Advanced Query Capabilities**: Enhanced [`AnalyticsQuery`](https://api.vapi.ai/api#:~:text=AnalyticsQuery) functionality enables sophisticated data analysis:
    - Multiple grouping dimensions for comprehensive insights
    - Variable-based segmentation for business intelligence
    - Custom metric tracking through extracted call variables

5. **Business Intelligence Integration**: Connect your call data to business outcomes by grouping analytics on:
    - Customer satisfaction scores extracted from calls
    - Product interest levels determined during conversations
    - Lead qualification status gathered through assistant interactions
    - Custom KPIs specific to your business logic

<Info>
    Variable values are extracted during calls using tool response schemas and aliases. Set up variable extraction in your tools to enable powerful analytics grouping based on conversation outcomes.

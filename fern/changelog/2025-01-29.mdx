# New workflow nodes, improved call handling, better phone number management, and expanded tool calling capabilities

1. **New Hangup Workflow Node**: You can now include a [`Hangup`](https://api.vapi.ai/api#:~:text=Hangup) node in your workflows to end calls programmatically.

2. **New HttpRequest Workflow Node**: Workflows can now make HTTP requests using the new [`HttpRequest`](https://api.vapi.ai/api#:~:text=HttpRequest) node, enabling integration with external APIs during workflow execution.

3. **Updates to Tool Calls**: The [`ToolCall`](https://api.vapi.ai/api#:~:text=ToolCall) schema has been revamped; you should update your tool calls to use the new `function` property with `id` and `function` details (instead of older `tool` and `toolBody` properties).

4. **Improvements to [Say](https://api.vapi.ai/api#:~:text=Say), [Edge](https://api.vapi.ai/api#:~:text=Edge), [Gather](https://api.vapi.ai/api#:~:text=Gather), and [Workflow](https://api.vapi.ai/api#:~:text=Workflow) Nodes**:
- The `name`, `to`, and `from` properties in these nodes now support up to 80 characters, letting you use more descriptive identifiers.
- A `metadata` property has been added to these nodes, allowing you to store additional information.
- The [`Gather`](https://api.vapi.ai/api#:~:text=Gather) node now supports a `confirmContent` option to confirm collected data with users.

5. **Regex Validation with Json Outputs**: You can now validate inputs and outputs from your conversations, tool calls, and OpenAI structured outputs against regular expressions using the `regex` property in [`JSON outputs`](https://api.vapi.ai/api#:~:text=JsonSchema) node.

6. **New Assistant Transfer Mode**: A new [transfer mode](https://api.vapi.ai/api#:~:text=TransferPlan) `swap-system-message-in-history-and-remove-transfer-tool-messages` allows more control over conversation history during assistant transfers.

7. **Area Code Selection for Vapi Phone Numbers**: You can now specify a desired area code when creating Vapi phone numbers using `numberDesiredAreaCode`.

8. **Chat Completions Support**: You can now handle chat messages and their metadata within your applications using familiar chat completion messages in your workflow nodes.

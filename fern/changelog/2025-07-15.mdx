1. **Standardized 'Provider Resources' API Summaries and Tags**: The API endpoints for provider resources now have clearer summaries and are grouped under the **Provider Resources** tag, making them easier to find and understand.

2. **Added `'westus2'` Azure Region Support**: You can now specify `'westus2'` as a region when configuring Azure credentials, allowing access to services in this new region.

3. **Removed `'trial'` Subscription Type**: The `'trial'` option has been removed from subscription types; ensure your application no longer uses `'trial'` and updates to valid subscription types.

1. **End AI call transfers after set timeout period**: You can now configure [AI-managed transfers](https://docs.vapi.ai/call-forwarding#7-assistant-based-warm-transfer-experimental) with a [Transfer Assistant](https://api.vapi.ai/api#:~:text=TransferAssistant) to automatically end the call after a specified period of silence with `silenceTimeoutSeconds` (default 30 seconds). This helps prevent idle calls from lingering and saves costs.

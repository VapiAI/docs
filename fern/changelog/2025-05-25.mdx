1. **New `transferCompleteAudioUrl` Property in `TransferPlan`:** You can now specify a custom audio file URL using `transferCompleteAudioUrl` in `TransferPlan` when using `warm-transfer-experimental` mode to play a sound after the transfer is complete. This allows you to add a custom notification (like a beep) for the destination party after delivering the message or summary.

2. **`body` Parameter in `CreateApiRequestToolDTO` Is Now Optional:** The `body` property has been removed from the required fields in `CreateApiRequestToolDTO`, so you no longer need to include it when creating an API request tool. This means you can create API requests without a body, useful for HTTP methods like GET or DELETE.

<Card title="Enhanced Campaign Analytics" icon="chart-line">
  **Gain deeper insight into campaign performance** with new call counters including `callsCounterQueued`, `callsCounterScheduled`, `callsCounterInProgress`, and `callsCounterEndedVoicemail` for comprehensive campaign tracking.
</Card>

<Card title="MCP Tool Protocols and Metadata" icon="tools">
  **Flexible tool integrations** with new [`McpToolMetadata`](https://api.vapi.ai/api#:~:text=McpToolMetadata) field. Select between Server-Sent Events (`sse`) or Streamable HTTP (`shttp`) protocols for tool communication.
</Card>

<Card title="Support Ticket Submission via API" icon="ticket" href="https://api.vapi.ai/api#:~:text=SupportTicket">
  **Create support tickets directly through Vapi ** using the new [`/support/ticket`](https://api.vapi.ai/api#:~:text=SupportTicket) endpoint, simplifying how you request assistance.
</Card>

1. **Multilingual LMNT Voice Support**: The [`LMNTVoice`](https://api.vapi.ai/api#:~:text=LMNTVoice) and [`FallbackLMNTVoice`](https://api.vapi.ai/api#:~:text=FallbackLMNTVoice) objects now support a `language` property (ISO 639-1 or `auto`) for selecting or auto-detecting spoken language in synthesized voices.

2. **Assistant Overrides in Chats**: The `assistantOverrides` property is now available in [`Chat`](https://api.vapi.ai/api#:~:text=Chat), [`CreateChatDTO`](https://api.vapi.ai/api#:~:text=CreateChatDTO), and [`OpenAIResponsesRequest`](https://api.vapi.ai/api#:~:text=OpenAIResponsesRequest), allowing you to dynamically override assistant settings and template variables per chat session.

3. **New API Endpoints and Objects**: Added `POST /workflow/generate` endpoint for workflow generation with tool IDs, plus new objects including `GenerateWorkflowDTO` and enhanced `CreateMcpToolDTO`/`UpdateMcpToolDTO` with metadata support.

4. **Include Messages in Server Response from Transfer Requests**: When transferring calls, you can now include a `message` to communicate with users during the process with [`ServerMessageResponse.message.message`](https://api.vapi.ai/api#:~:text=ServerMessageResponse).

<Warning>
**Breaking Change**: The `'aws-sts'` type is no longer supported in [`OAuth2AuthenticationPlan`](https://api.vapi.ai/api#:~:text=OAuth2AuthenticationPlan). If you're currently using this type in your OAuth2 authentication configurations, you'll need to update it to avoid errors.
</Warning>

1. **New Voicemail Detection Configuration**: You can now configure voicemail detection for assistants with Vapi using the new [`VapiVoicemailDetectionPlan`](https://api.vapi.ai/api#:~:text=VapiVoicemailDetectionPlan). This feature allows you to control how Vapi handles voicemail detection, including specifying the provider, backoff strategy, and maximum wait time for a voicemail beep. Refer to [Voicemail Detection documentation](https://docs.vapi.ai/calls/voicemail-detection) for more information, and configure it on the [Assistants tab](https://dashboard.vapi.ai/assistants#:~:text=Voicemail%20Detection).

2. **Control SMS Capabilities on Twilio Numbers**: You can now enable or disable SMS functionality on your Twilio phone numbers with the new `smsEnabled` property. By setting `smsEnabled` to `false`, Vapi will not update the messaging webhook URL during phone number import or creation, allowing you to manage SMS settings independently.

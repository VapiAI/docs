# Voice Enhancements & Minimax Improvements

1. **Minimax Voice Language Support**: Enhance multilingual conversations with [`MinimaxVoice.languageBoost`](https://api.vapi.ai/api#:~:text=MinimaxVoice.languageBoost). Support for 40+ languages including:
    - `Chinese` and `Chinese,Yue` for Mandarin and Cantonese
    - `English`, `Spanish`, `French`, `German`, `Japanese`, `Korean`
    - Regional variants and specialized languages like `Arabic`, `Hindi`, `Thai`
    - `auto` mode for automatic language detection

2. **Text Normalization**: Improve number reading and formatting with [`MinimaxVoice.textNormalizationEnabled`](https://api.vapi.ai/api#:~:text=MinimaxVoice.textNormalizationEnabled). When enabled, spoken numbers, dates, and formatted text are properly pronounced for natural-sounding conversations.

3. **Enhanced Voice Caching**: Voice responses are now cached by default with [`MinimaxVoice.cachingEnabled`](https://api.vapi.ai/api#:~:text=MinimaxVoice.cachingEnabled) set to `true`, reducing latency for repeated phrases and improving overall conversation performance.

4. **Fallback Voice Configuration**: Ensure conversation continuity with [`FallbackMinimaxVoice`](https://api.vapi.ai/api#:~:text=FallbackMinimaxVoice) featuring the same language boost and text normalization capabilities as the primary voice configuration.

5. **Speaker Labeling**: Track multiple speakers in conversations with [`BotMessage.speakerLabel`](https://api.vapi.ai/api#:~:text=BotMessage.speakerLabel), providing stable speaker identification (e.g., "Speaker 1") for better conversation analysis and diarization.

6. **Voice Region Support**: Choose optimal performance regions with Minimax's `worldwide` (default) or `china` regional settings for better latency and compliance with local regulations.

<Info>
    Language boost settings help the text-to-speech model better understand context and pronunciation for specific languages, resulting in more natural and accurate voice synthesis.

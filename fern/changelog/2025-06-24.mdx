  You can now use Inworld as a voice provider by selecting [`Inworld`](https://dashboard.vapi.ai/assistants#:~:text=VOICE-,Voice%20Configuration,-Select%20a%20voice) in your configuration. You can also route your InWorld credentials under [Settings > Integrations](https://dashboard.vapi.ai/settings/integrations#:~:text=Save-,Inworld,-For%20using%20voices). Finally, there are new `Call.endedReason` codes to help you better understand why calls ended due to Inworld voice issues.

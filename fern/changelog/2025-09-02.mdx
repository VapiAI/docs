# Recording Consent & Compliance Management

1. **Recording Consent Plans**: Ensure legal compliance with call recording regulations using the new [`CompliancePlan.recordingConsentPlan`](https://api.vapi.ai/api#:~:text=CompliancePlan.recordingConsentPlan). This feature helps you meet GDPR, CCPA, and other privacy regulations by properly obtaining user consent before recording calls.

2. **Verbal Consent Collection**: Implement active consent collection with [`RecordingConsentPlanVerbal`](https://api.vapi.ai/api#:~:text=RecordingConsentPlanVerbal) where users explicitly agree or decline recording:
    - `message`: Custom consent message (e.g., "This call may be recorded for quality purposes. Say 'I agree' to consent.")
    - `voice`: Optional dedicated voice for consent messages for better user experience
    - `declineTool`: Execute specific tools when users decline consent
    - `declineToolId`: Reference existing tools for decline handling

3. **Stay-on-Line Consent**: Use passive consent collection with [`RecordingConsentPlanStayOnLine`](https://api.vapi.ai/api#:~:text=RecordingConsentPlanStayOnLine) where staying on the call implies consent:
    - `message`: Informational message about recording (e.g., "For quality purposes, this call may be recorded. Please hang up if you do not consent.")
    - `waitSeconds`: Configurable wait time (1-6 seconds) before proceeding
    - `voice`: Optional separate voice for consent announcements

4. **Recording Consent Tracking**: Monitor consent status throughout the call lifecycle with [`Call.compliance.recordingConsent`](https://api.vapi.ai/api#:~:text=Call.compliance.recordingConsent):
    - `type`: The type of consent obtained
    - `grantedAt`: Timestamp when consent was granted (null if not granted)

5. **Enhanced End-of-Call Reports**: Recording consent information is now included in [`ServerMessageEndOfCallReport.compliance`](https://api.vapi.ai/api#:~:text=ServerMessageEndOfCallReport.compliance), providing complete compliance audit trails for your records.

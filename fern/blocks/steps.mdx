subtitle: Building and Controlling Conversation Flow for Your Assistants

[**Steps**](https://api.vapi.ai/api#:~:text=HandoffStep) are the core building blocks that dictate how conversations progress in a bot interaction. Each Step represents a distinct point in the conversation where the bot performs an action, gathers information, or decides where to go next. Think of Steps as checkpoints in a conversation that guide the flow, manage user inputs, and determine outcomes. 

<Note>
  Blocks is currently in beta. We're excited to have you try this new feature and welcome your [feedback](https://discord.com/invite/pUFNcf2WmH) as we continue to refine and improve the experience.

#### Features

- **Output:** The data or response expected from the step, as outlined in the block's `outputSchema`.
- **Input:** The data necessary for the step to execute, defined in the block's `inputSchema`.
- [**Destinations:**](https://api.vapi.ai/api#:~:text=StepDestination) This can be determined by a simple linear progression or based on specific criteria, like conditions or rules set within the Step. This enables dynamic decision-making, allowing the assistant to choose the next Step depending on what happens during the conversation (e.g., user input, a specific value, or a condition being met).

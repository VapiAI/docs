## Required information

Outbound Campaigns only require a number to work. `number` column is required and needs to be spelled in lowercase.

| number |  |
| --- | --- |
| +14151231234 |  |
| +14153455678 |  |

<Note>
Phone numbers must be formatted in E.164 format: [+] [country code] [subscriber number including area code]
- Example: +14151234567
- Maximum 15 digits total
- No spaces or special characters
</Note>

## Tips for Clean Data
- Use UTF-8 encoding when saving your CSV.
- Avoid blank rows or duplicated headers.
- Double-check that your column names match the variables used in your assistant.

## Avoiding Spam

To maximize call answer rates and establish trust with recipients, you should implement proper caller identification and trusted calling standards. This involves several key components that work together to verify your identity and build caller reputation.

## Dynamic variables

Outbound Campaigns allows users to specify dynamic variables to pass to Assistants via additional columns in the CSV file. Outbound Campaigns can take one more additional columns.

| number | name | customer_issue |
| --- | --- | --- |
| +14151231234 | John | password reset |
| +14153455678 | Mary | address update |

`{{name}}` and `{{customer_issue}}` can be used in the Assistant prompt as dynamic variables, based on this CSV file.

<Note>
- Column names cannot have spaces. Use `{{customer_issue}}` instead of `{{customer issue}}`
- Column names must start with a letter
- Users can use the same [Default Variables](/assistants/dynamic-variables#default-variables) as they can within Assistants
</Note>

## Concurrency

Check concurrency limits in your Vapi organization. If your org has a concurrency limit of 10, a maximum of 10 calls will be started at a single time. The rest of the calls will be queued and retried a few minutes later as your concurrency slots become available. To increase call rate, you need you increase your Vapi org concurrency limit.

Note that concurrency limits are on the Vapi side. Your telephony provider (e.g. Twilio) may have other rate limits.

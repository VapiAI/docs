## Overview

The Vapi CLI is the official command-line interface that brings world-class developer experience to your terminal and IDE. Build, test, and deploy voice AI applications without leaving your development environment.

**In this guide, you'll learn to:**
- Install and authenticate with the Vapi CLI
- Initialize Vapi in existing projects
- Manage assistants, phone numbers, and workflows from your terminal
- Test webhooks locally without external tunnels
- Turn your IDE into a Vapi expert with MCP integration

## Installation

Install the Vapi CLI in seconds with our automated scripts:

<Tabs>
  <Tab title="macOS/Linux">
    ```bash
    curl -sSL https://vapi.ai/install.sh | bash
    ```

## Key features

### üöÄ Project integration

Drop Vapi into any existing codebase with intelligent auto-detection:

```bash
vapi init
# Detected: Next.js application
# ‚úì Installed @vapi-ai/web SDK
# ‚úì Generated components/VapiButton.tsx
# ‚úì Created pages/api/vapi/webhook.ts
# ‚úì Added environment template
```

Supports React, Vue, Next.js, Python, Go, Flutter, React Native, and dozens more frameworks.

### ü§ñ MCP integration

Turn your IDE into a Vapi expert with Model Context Protocol:

```bash
vapi mcp setup
```

Your IDE's AI assistant (Cursor, Windsurf, VSCode) gains complete, accurate knowledge of Vapi's APIs and best practices. No more hallucinated code or outdated examples.

### üîó Local webhook testing

Debug webhooks instantly without ngrok:

```bash
vapi listen --forward-to localhost:3000/webhook
```

All webhook events get forwarded to your local server in real-time with helpful debugging information.

### üîê Multi-account management

Switch between organizations and environments seamlessly:

```bash
# List all authenticated accounts
vapi auth status

# Switch between accounts
vapi auth switch production

# Add another account
vapi auth login
```

### üì± Complete feature parity

Everything you can do in the dashboard, now in your terminal:

- **Assistants**: Create, update, list, and delete voice assistants
- **Phone numbers**: Purchase, configure, and manage phone numbers
- **Calls**: Make outbound calls and view call history
- **Workflows**: Manage conversation flows (visual editing in dashboard)
- **Campaigns**: Create and manage AI phone campaigns at scale

export VAPI_API_KEY=your-api-key

# View current configuration
vapi config get

# Update configuration
vapi config set <key> <value>

# Manage analytics preferences
vapi config analytics disable
```

## Auto-updates

The CLI automatically checks for updates and notifies you when new versions are available:

```bash
# Check for updates manually
vapi update check

# Update to latest version
vapi update
```

## Next steps

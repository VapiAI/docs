At Vapi, safeguarding your personal data is our top priority. In full alignment with the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR), we maintain robust standards for data protection and privacy. This document provides an overview of our data processing practices, legal bases, data subject rights, and the security measures we employ—all designed to ensure that your data is managed with the utmost care.

## Data Processing & Legal Bases

Our operations involve the secure processing of various types of personal data to enhance and deliver the Vapi service. We process information such as email addresses, names, phone numbers, physical addresses, usage statistics, and location data. The legal grounds underpinning this processing are:

- **Consent:** Users voluntarily provide consent for non-essential data processing (e.g., location-based services and marketing communications). This consent can be withdrawn at any time.
- **Contractual Necessity:** We process the data essential for fulfilling the services offered through Vapi, as detailed in our terms of service.
- **Legitimate Interests:** Data is processed to improve service functionality, enhance security, and analyze usage patterns, provided that our legitimate interests do not override your rights.

## Data Subject Rights

Vapi ensures that every user benefits from the robust rights granted by the GDPR. These rights include:

- **Right to Access:** You can request and obtain a copy of your personal data.
- **Right to Rectification:** If your data is inaccurate or incomplete, you can request corrections.
- **Right to Erasure (Right to be Forgotten):** Under certain conditions, you can ask for your personal data to be deleted.
- **Right to Restrict Processing:** You have the option to limit how your data is processed.
- **Right to Data Portability:** You can obtain and transfer your data in a structured, commonly used format.
- **Right to Withdraw Consent:** If your data processing is based on consent, you can withdraw it at any time.

## Data Security Measures

We deploy a range of technical and organizational safeguards to protect your personal data from unauthorized access, alteration, disclosure, and destruction, including:

- **Encryption:** Data is encrypted in transit and at rest.
- **Secure Server Configurations:** Our infrastructure is optimized for enhanced security.
- **Access Controls:** Strict controls ensure that only authorized personnel access sensitive data.
- **Regular Assessments:** Security audits and penetration tests are routinely performed to identify and address vulnerabilities.

## Transborder Data Transfers

In cases where personal data is transferred outside the European Union (primarily to the United States), we ensure that all transfers are governed by legally approved safeguards such as standard contractual clauses. These measures guarantee that your data receives the same level of protection, regardless of where it is processed.

## Compliance Testing & Continuous Improvement

To reinforce our GDPR compliance, we conduct routine testing and audits including:

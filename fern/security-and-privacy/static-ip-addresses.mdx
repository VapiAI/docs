## Introduction to Vapi static IP addresses

Vapi supports static IP addresses for outbound HTTP requests. When enabled, all HTTP requests from Vapi to your server will originate from a fixed set of IP addresses, allowing you to configure strict firewall rules and network security policies.

## Why use static IP addresses

Static IP addresses provide an additional layer of security for your infrastructure by allowing you to:

- **Control network access** - Restrict incoming traffic to only trusted sources
- **Simplify firewall rules** - Define precise IP based access controls
- **Meet compliance requirements** - Satisfy security policies that mandate IP whitelisting
- **Audit traffic sources** - Verify that requests are genuinely from Vapi's infrastructure

## Vapi's static IP addresses

When static IP addressing is enabled, all webhook requests from Vapi will originate from the following CIDR block:

- `167.150.224.0/23`

## Enabling static IP addresses

You can enable static IP addressing through the server object

### Example

```json
{
  "serverUrl": "https://your-server.example.com/webhook",
  "staticIpAddressesEnabled": true
}
```

<Warning>
Always test static IP configuration in a staging environment before deploying to production to avoid service disruptions.

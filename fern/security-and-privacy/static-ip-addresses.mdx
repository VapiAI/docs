title: Static IP addresses
subtitle: Configure Vapi to send requests from a fixed IP range for firewall whitelisting
slug: security-and-privacy/static-ip-addresses
---

## Overview

Vapi supports static IP addresses for outbound HTTP requests. When enabled, all HTTP requests from Vapi to your server will originate from a fixed set of IP addresses, allowing you to configure strict firewall rules and network security policies.

**Static IP addressing allows you to:**

- Whitelist specific IPs in your firewall configuration
- Meet enterprise security and compliance requirements
- Audit and verify that requests genuinely originate from Vapi
- Integrate with corporate networks that restrict inbound traffic

<Info>
Static IP addresses apply to **outbound HTTP requests** from Vapi to your servers, including webhook events, tool calls, and custom transcriber requests.
</Info>

## Vapi's static IP range

When static IP addressing is enabled, all requests from Vapi will originate from the following CIDR block:

```txt title="Static IP CIDR Range"
167.150.224.0/23
```

This CIDR range includes IP addresses from `167.150.224.0` to `167.150.225.255` (512 addresses total).

<Tip>
Add this CIDR range to your firewall's allowlist to permit traffic from Vapi's static IP infrastructure.
</Tip>

## Enabling static IP addresses

You can enable static IP addressing through the `server` configuration object. Set `staticIpAddressesEnabled` to `true` in any server configuration.

### Assistant server configuration

Enable static IPs for webhook requests sent to your assistant's server URL:

<CodeBlocks>
```json title="API Request"
{
  "name": "Support Assistant",
  "server": {
    "url": "https://api.yourcompany.com/webhook",
    "staticIpAddressesEnabled": true
  },
  "model": {
    "provider": "openai",
    "model": "gpt-4"
  }
}
```

```typescript title="TypeScript SDK"
import { VapiClient } from "@vapi-ai/server-sdk";

const client = new VapiClient({ token: process.env.VAPI_API_KEY });

const assistant = await client.assistants.create({
  name: "Support Assistant",
  server: {
    url: "https://api.yourcompany.com/webhook",
    staticIpAddressesEnabled: true
  },
  model: {
    provider: "openai",
    model: "gpt-4"
  }
});
```

```python title="Python SDK"
from vapi import Vapi
import os

client = Vapi(token=os.getenv("VAPI_API_KEY"))

assistant = client.assistants.create(
    name="Support Assistant",
    server={
        "url": "https://api.yourcompany.com/webhook",
        "staticIpAddressesEnabled": True
    },
    model={
        "provider": "openai",
        "model": "gpt-4"
    }
)
```

```bash title="cURL"
curl -X POST "https://api.vapi.ai/assistant" \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer $VAPI_API_KEY" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{
    "name": "Support Assistant",
    "server": {
      "url": "https://api.yourcompany.com/webhook",
      "staticIpAddressesEnabled": true
    },
    "model": {
      "provider": "openai",
      "model": "gpt-4"
    }
  }'
```
</CodeBlocks>

### Phone number server configuration

Enable static IPs for incoming call webhooks on a phone number:

<CodeBlocks>
```json title="API Request"
{
  "number": "+14155551234",
  "server": {
    "url": "https://api.yourcompany.com/calls",
    "staticIpAddressesEnabled": true
  }
}
```

```typescript title="TypeScript SDK"
const phoneNumber = await client.phoneNumbers.update("phone-number-id", {
  server: {
    url: "https://api.yourcompany.com/calls",
    staticIpAddressesEnabled: true
  }
});
```

```python title="Python SDK"
phone_number = client.phone_numbers.update(
    "phone-number-id",
    server={
        "url": "https://api.yourcompany.com/calls",
        "staticIpAddressesEnabled": True
    }
)
```
</CodeBlocks>

### Tool server configuration

Enable static IPs for custom tool endpoints:

<CodeBlocks>
```json title="API Request"
{
  "type": "function",
  "function": {
    "name": "get_customer_data",
    "description": "Retrieve customer information from CRM",
    "parameters": {
      "type": "object",
      "properties": {
        "customerId": { "type": "string" }
      },
      "required": ["customerId"]
    }
  },
  "server": {
    "url": "https://api.yourcompany.com/crm/customer",
    "staticIpAddressesEnabled": true
  }
}
```

```typescript title="TypeScript SDK"
const tool = await client.tools.create({
  type: "function",
  function: {
    name: "get_customer_data",
    description: "Retrieve customer information from CRM",
    parameters: {
      type: "object",
      properties: {
        customerId: { type: "string" }
      },
      required: ["customerId"]
    }
  },
  server: {
    url: "https://api.yourcompany.com/crm/customer",
    staticIpAddressesEnabled: true
  }
});
```

```python title="Python SDK"
tool = client.tools.create(
    type="function",
    function={
        "name": "get_customer_data",
        "description": "Retrieve customer information from CRM",
        "parameters": {
            "type": "object",
            "properties": {
                "customerId": {"type": "string"}
            },
            "required": ["customerId"]
        }
    },
    server={
        "url": "https://api.yourcompany.com/crm/customer",
        "staticIpAddressesEnabled": True
    }
)
```
</CodeBlocks>

## Use cases

### Enterprise security requirements

Many enterprise environments require strict network access controls. Static IP addresses enable you to:

- Comply with corporate security policies that mandate IP whitelisting
- Integrate with on-premise systems behind corporate firewalls
- Meet regulatory requirements for controlled network access

### Audit and compliance

Static IPs provide a verifiable source for request origin:

- Log and audit all incoming requests from the known IP range
- Verify that webhook requests genuinely originate from Vapi
- Support compliance audits with clear network traffic documentation

### Multi-layer security

Combine static IP whitelisting with other security measures:

- **IP whitelisting** + **[Server authentication](/server-url/server-authentication)** for defense in depth
- **IP whitelisting** + **TLS/HTTPS** for encrypted, verified traffic
- **IP whitelisting** + **Request signing** for tamper-proof webhooks

## FAQ

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="What requests use static IP addresses?">
    When enabled, static IP addresses apply to all outbound HTTP requests from Vapi to your servers, including:

    - Webhook events (call status, transcripts, end-of-call reports)
    - Custom tool calls
    - Assistant request callbacks
    - Custom transcriber requests

    Static IPs do **not** apply to:
    - SIP/RTP media traffic
    - WebSocket connections initiated by your client SDKs
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Is there additional cost for static IP addresses?">
    Contact our sales team for pricing information about static IP addresses. This feature may be included in certain enterprise plans.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Can I use static IPs with existing authentication?">
    Yes. Static IP addresses work alongside all authentication methods:

    - Bearer token authentication
    - OAuth 2.0
    - HMAC signatures
    - Custom headers

    We recommend using static IPs **in addition to** authentication for defense in depth.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="What happens if I enable static IPs for some configurations but not others?">
    Static IP addressing is configured per server object. You can enable it for specific assistants, phone numbers, or tools while leaving others on dynamic IPs. Each configuration is independent.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Will the static IP range change?">
    Vapi's static IP range (`167.150.224.0/23`) is stable and changes are rare. If changes are necessary, we will provide advance notice to affected customers. Subscribe to our status page for infrastructure updates.

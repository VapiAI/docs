title: "Debug call forwarding drops"
subtitle: "Learn to troubleshoot calls that drop immediately after initiating transfer"
---

## Overview

When you initiate call forwarding, you expect the call to transfer to the destination. Instead, the call drops immediately after initiating the transfer, leaving both parties disconnected.

**In this guide, you'll learn to:**

- Identify why calls drop during forwarding
- Check call logs and API responses systematically
- Analyze telephony provider logs for transfer failures
- Resolve configuration issues preventing successful transfers

<Note>
  This guide focuses on the specific scenario where calls drop immediately after
  transfer initiation, not general call quality issues.
</Note>

## Prerequisites

Before you start debugging, ensure you have:

- **Call ID** from the dropped call
- **API access** to make GET requests to Vapi
- **Admin access** to your telephony provider dashboard (Twilio, Vonage, Telnyx)
- **Wireshark** installed (for SIP-based calls only)

## Troubleshooting workflow

<Steps>
<Step title="Check call ended reason">

First, verify whether Vapi successfully initiated the forwarding.

<CodeBlocks>
```bash title="cURL"
curl -X GET "https://api.vapi.ai/call/{call_id}" \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer YOUR_API_KEY" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json"
```

```typescript title="TypeScript SDK"
import { VapiClient } from "@vapi-ai/server-sdk";

const client = new VapiClient({ token: process.env.VAPI_API_KEY });
const call = await client.calls.get("ca123456xxxxx");
console.log("End reason:", call.endedReason);
```

```python title="Python SDK"
from vapi import Vapi

client = Vapi(token=os.getenv("VAPI_API_KEY"))
call = client.calls.get("ca123456xxxxx")
print(f"End reason: {call.ended_reason}")
```

</CodeBlocks>

**Check the response:**

```json title="Expected response"
{
  "id": "ca123456xxxxx",
  "endedReason": "assistant-forwarded-call",
  "status": "ended",
  "destination": {
    "type": "number",
    "number": "+1234567890"
  },
  "phoneCallProviderId": "twilio_call_abc123"
}
```

**What the `endedReason` tells you:**

- `"assistant-forwarded-call"` → Vapi forwarded successfully, continue to Step 2
- Any other value → Forwarding wasn't initiated, check your assistant configuration

</Step>

<Step title="Verify server message configuration">

If you're handling call control through server messages, this can prevent Vapi from managing transfers.

Check your assistant's `serverMessages` configuration:

<CodeBlocks>
```json title="Problematic configuration"
{
  "assistant": {
    "serverMessages": ["phone-call-control", "status-update"]
  }
}
```

```json title="Correct configuration"
{
  "assistant": {
    "serverMessages": ["status-update"]
  }
}
```

</CodeBlocks>

<Warning>
  If `"phone-call-control"` is present, your server is overriding Vapi's call
  control. Remove it unless you're implementing custom transfer logic.
</Warning>

</Step>

<Step title="Check phone call provider bypass">

The `phoneCallProviderBypassEnabled` flag determines whether Vapi handles call control directly.

**Recommended configuration:**

```json title="Standard Vapi forwarding"
{
  "phoneCallProviderBypassEnabled": false
}
```

<Tip>
  Only set this to `true` if you're implementing custom call control through
  your telephony provider.
</Tip>

</Step>

<Step title="Validate transfer scenario compatibility">

Not all transfer scenarios are supported. Verify your use case:

| From       | To           | Supported           |
| ---------- | ------------ | ------------------- |
| Phone call | Phone number | ✅ Yes              |
| Web call   | Phone number | ❌ No               |
| Phone call | SIP number   | ❌ No (PSTN to SIP) |
| SIP call   | SIP number   | ✅ Yes              |
| SIP call   | Phone number | ✅ Yes              |

<Error>
  Web-to-phone transfers are not supported. The call will always drop in this
  scenario.
</Error>

</Step>

<Step title="Analyze telephony provider logs">

If the call shows `"assistant-forwarded-call"` but still drops, the issue is likely with your telephony provider.

**Get your telephony call ID** from the Vapi call object:

```json title="Extract telephony call ID"
{
  "id": "ca123456xxxxx",
  "endedReason": "assistant-forwarded-call",
  "phoneCallProviderId": "CAabc123"
}
```

**Check your provider's dashboard:**

<Tabs>
<Tab title="Twilio">
1. Go to [Twilio Console > Call Logs](https://console.twilio.com/us1/monitor/logs/calls)
2. Search using `phoneCallProviderId` (e.g., `CAabc123`)
3. Look for transfer-related errors in the call timeline
4. Check TwiML execution logs for failed transfers
</Tab>

<Tab title="Vonage">
  1. Access [Vonage API Dashboard](https://dashboard.nexmo.com/) 2. Navigate to
  Call Logs 3. Search using the telephony call ID and timestamp 4. Review call
  flow details for transfer failures
</Tab>

<Tab title="Telnyx">  
1. Open [Telnyx Mission Control Portal](https://portal.telnyx.com/)
2. Go to Call Detail Records
3. Search using the telephony call ID
4. Examine call records for forwarding errors
</Tab>
</Tabs>

</Step>

<Step title="Analyze SIP packets (SIP calls only)">

For SIP trunking or bring-your-own-number setups, analyze the SIP signaling.

**Download the packet capture:**

```bash title="Get PCAP file"
curl -X GET "https://api.vapi.ai/call/{call_id}" \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer YOUR_API_KEY"
```

The response includes a `pcapUrl` field. Download this file and open it in Wireshark.

**Filter for transfer packets:**

```text title="Wireshark filter"
sip.Method == "REFER"
```

**What to look for:**

- **REFER packet present** → Vapi sent the transfer request to your SIP provider
- **REFER packet missing** → Transfer wasn't initiated by Vapi
- **202 Accepted response** → SIP provider accepted the transfer
- **Error responses (4xx, 5xx)** → SIP provider rejected the transfer

<Info>
  **Important:** SIP transfers are handled by your telephony provider, not Vapi.
  Once Vapi sends the REFER packet, your SIP provider manages the actual
  transfer process.
</Info>

For more details on SIP configuration, see our [SIP trunk documentation](https://docs.vapi.ai/advanced/sip/sip-trunk#inbound-call-test).

## Common solutions

Based on your findings, here are the most frequent fixes:

### Call shows successful forwarding but still drops

**Root cause:** Telephony provider couldn't complete the transfer

**Solution:** Check destination number format and availability

- Verify the destination number includes country code
- Test calling the destination directly outside of Vapi
- Check if destination has call blocking enabled

### endedReason is not 'assistant-forwarded-call'

**Root cause:** Transfer wasn't initiated due to configuration

**Solution:** Review assistant settings

- Remove `"phone-call-control"` from `serverMessages`
- Set `phoneCallProviderBypassEnabled` to `false`
- Verify your transfer function is properly configured

### SIP REFER packets missing in PCAP

**Root cause:** Vapi didn't send transfer request to SIP provider

**Solution:** Check Vapi configuration

- Verify SIP endpoint configuration
- Ensure destination format matches SIP addressing
- Check for conflicting call control settings

## Limitations

### Transfer scenario limitations

- **Web calls** cannot be transferred to phone numbers
- **PSTN-to-SIP** transfers are not supported
- Cross-provider transfers may have compatibility issues

### Configuration dependencies

- `phoneCallProviderBypassEnabled` must be `false` for Vapi-managed transfers
- `serverMessages` with `"phone-call-control"` overrides default behavior
- SIP configuration requires proper endpoint setup

## When to contact support

Escalate to support when you've completed all troubleshooting steps and:

- Provider logs show successful transfers but calls consistently fail
- SIP packet analysis indicates Vapi-side transfer issues
- Multiple destinations fail with the same configuration
- Configuration changes don't resolve recurring failures

**Include in your support request:**

- Call ID and timestamp
- Complete troubleshooting results from this guide
- Telephony provider error codes and logs
- Screenshots of configuration settings

## Next steps

Now that you can debug call forwarding drops:

- **Monitor call patterns:** Set up alerts for calls with unexpected `endedReason` values
- **Test systematically:** Verify transfers work across different destination types before production
- **Review SIP setup:** Ensure your SIP configuration follows our [advanced SIP guide](https://docs.vapi.ai/advanced/sip/sip-trunk)

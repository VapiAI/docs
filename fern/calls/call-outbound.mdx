## Introduction to Outbound Calling

Vapi’s outbound calling API lets you programmatically initiate single or batch calls to any phone number. You can schedule calls for specific dates and times, ideal for time-sensitive communications. Easily integrate outbound calling into your app for appointment reminders, automated surveys, and call campaigns.

## Prerequisites

- **Vapi Account**: Access to the Vapi Dashboard for configuration.
- **Configured Assistant**: Either a saved assistant or a transient assistant.
- **Phone Number**: Either an imported phone number from one of the supported providers or a free Vapi number. (Note: You cannot make international calls with a free Vapi number).
- **Customer's Phone Number**: The phone number that you want to call.

## Outbound Calls

You can place an outbound call from one of your phone numbers using the [`/call`](/api-reference/calls/create-phone-call) endpoint.

1. **Specify an Assistant:** you must specify either a transient assistant in the `assistant` field or reuse a saved assistant in the `assistantId` field.
2. **Get a Phone Number:** provide the `phoneNumberId` of the imported number or free Vapi number you wish to call from.
3. **Provide a Destination:** Finally, pass the customer's phone number or SIP URI in [`customer`](/api-reference/calls/create#request.body.customer).

Provide your authorization token and now we're ready to issue the API call!

```jsx
{
    "assistantId": "assistant-id",
    "phoneNumberId": "phone-number-id",
    "customer": {
        "number": "+11231231234"
    }
}
```

## Scheduling Outbound Calls

To schedule a call for the future, use the [`schedulePlan`](/api-reference/calls/create#request.body.schedulePlan) parameter and pass a future ISO date-time string to `earliestAt`. This will be the earliest time Vapi will attempt to trigger the outbound call. You may also provider `latestAt`, which will be the latest time Vapi will attempt to trigger the call.

When you schedule a call, we will save the Assistant, Phone Number, and Customer Number resources and refetch them at the time of the call. If you choose to provide a saved assistant through `assistantId`, we will pick up the most up-to-date version of your assistant at the call time. Likewise, if you delete your saved assistant, the call will fail! To ensure the call is issued with a static version of an assistant, pass it as a transient assistant through the `assistant` parameter.

```jsx
{
    "assistantId": "assistant-id",
    "phoneNumberId": "phone-number-id",
    "customer": {
        "number": "+11231231234"
    },
    "schedulePlan": {
        "earliestAt": "2025-05-30T00:00:00Z"
    }
}
```

## Batch Calling [#batch-calling]

To call more than one number at a time, use the [`customers`](/api-reference/calls/create#request.body.customers) parameter to pass an array of `customer`. To provide customer specific assistant overrides, please call the endpoint separately for each destination number.

Use both `customers` and `schedulePlan` together to schedule batched calls.

```jsx
{
    "assistantId": "assistant-id",
    "phoneNumberId": "phone-number-id",
    "customers": [
        {
            "number": "+11231231234"
        },
        {
            "number": "+12342342345"
        }
    ],
    "schedulePlan": {
        "earliestAt": "2025-05-30T00:00:00Z"
    }
}
```

## Uploading Your CSV File to the Dashboard

Use the [`example template`](/assets/batch-sample.csv) to get started.

* The only required columns are **`phone`** and **`name`**.
* Any other columns (like `appointment_time`, `location`, etc.) can be used as dynamic variables in your assistant’s script.

## How to Launch a Batch Call

1. Go to **Phone Numbers** in the sidebar.
2. Select the **number** you want to call from.
3. Scroll to **Outbound Settings** → click **Call Many Numbers**.
4. **Upload your CSV file** (drag & drop or click to upload).
5. Select your **Assistant**, **Squad**, or **Workflow**.
6. Click **Make Calls** to start now, or **Schedule Calls** to set a future date/time.

>    *Calls will run concurrently — not sequentially.*

## Tips for Clean Data

* Use **UTF-8 encoding** when saving your CSV.
* Avoid blank rows or duplicated headers.
* Double-check that your column names match the variables used in your assistant.


Note: Vapi free numbers have limited number of outbound calls per day. Import a number from Twilio, Vonage, or Telnyx to scale without limits.

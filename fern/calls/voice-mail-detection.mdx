Voicemail is basically a digital answering machine. When you can’t pick up, callers can leave a message so you don’t miss anything important. It’s especially handy if you’re in a meeting, driving, or just can’t get to the phone in time.

### **The Main Problem**

If a lot of your calls are landing in voicemail, you could be spending too much time and money on calls that never connect to a real person. This leads to wasted resources, and sometimes missed business opportunities.

### **The Solution: Early Voicemail Detection**

By detecting voicemail right away, your VAPI Assistant can either hang up (if leaving a message isn’t necessary) or smoothly play a recorded message. This cuts down on useless call time and makes your entire call flow more efficient.

## **Two Ways to Detect Voicemail**

### **1. Using Twilio’s Voicemail Detection**

Twilio has built-in features to detect when a machine picks up. You configure these settings in your VAPI Assistant so it knows when a voicemail system has answered instead of a live person.

```jsx
voicemailDetection: {
  provider: "twilio",
  voicemailDetectionTypes: [
    "machine_start",
    "machine_end_beep",
    "machine_end_silence",
    "unknown",
    "machine_end_other"
  ],
  enabled: true,
  machineDetectionTimeout: 15,
  machineDetectionSpeechThreshold: 2500,
  machineDetectionSpeechEndThreshold: 2050,
  machineDetectionSilenceTimeout: 2000
}

```

- **provider**: Tells VAPI to use Twilio’s system.
- **voicemailDetectionTypes**: Defines the events that mean “voicemail.”
- **machineDetectionTimeout**: How many seconds to wait to confirm a machine.
- The other settings let you fine-tune how quickly or accurately Twilio identifies a machine based on speech or silence.

#### Quick Reference

| Setting                            | Type   | Valid Range   | Default  |
| ---------------------------------- | ------ | ------------- | -------- |
| machineDetectionTimeout            | number | 3 – 59 (sec)  | 30 (sec) |
| machineDetectionSpeechThreshold    | number | 1000–6000 ms  | 2400 ms  |
| machineDetectionSpeechEndThreshold | number | 500–5000 ms   | 1200 ms  |
| machineDetectionSilenceTimeout     | number | 2000–10000 ms | 5000 ms  |

### **2. Using VAPI’s Built-In Voicemail Tool**

VAPI also has an LLM-powered tool that listens for typical voicemail greetings or prompts in the call’s audio transcription. If you prefer an approach that relies more on phrasing and context clues, this is a great option.

```jsx
{
  ...yourExistingSettings,
  "model": {
    "tools": [{ type: "voicemail" }]
  }
}

```

Here, `tools: [{ type: "voicemail" }]` signals that your VAPI Assistant should look for keywords or patterns indicating a voicemail greeting.

## **Combining Both Approaches**

For the best of both worlds, you can enable Twilio’s detection **and** the built-in voicemail tool at the same time:

```jsx
{
  ...yourExistingSettings,
  voicemailDetection: {
    provider: "twilio",
    voicemailDetectionTypes: [
      "machine_start",
      "machine_end_beep",
      "unknown"
    ],
    enabled: true,
    machineDetectionTimeout: 15
  },
  model: {
    tools: [{ type: "voicemail" }]
  }
}

```

When one method doesn’t catch it, the other might—boosting your overall detection accuracy.

## **Tips for Better Voicemail Handling**

1. **Adjust Detection Timing**

   Lower `machineDetectionTimeout` (e.g., to 5 seconds) if you want the system to decide faster. But remember, shorter timeouts can lead to occasional false positives.

2. **Fine-Tune Speech and Silence Thresholds**

   For example:

   ```jsx
   {
     "provider": "twilio",
     "enabled": true,
     "machineDetectionTimeout": 5,
     "machineDetectionSpeechThreshold": 2400,
     "machineDetectionSpeechEndThreshold": 1000,
     "machineDetectionSilenceTimeout": 3000
   }

   ```

   These values tweak how quickly Twilio “listens” for human speech or background silence.

3. **Think Through Your Call Flow**
   - **Give It Time**: If you’re leaving a message, you might want to increase `startSpeakingPlan.waitSeconds` so the detection has enough time before the tone.
   - **firstMessageMode**: Setting it to `assistant-waits-for-user` can also give you smoother call handling—your assistant won’t barge in if someone unexpectedly picks up late

## **What Happens When a Call Ends?**

- **Detected Voicemail + No Message**: The call will end, and you’ll see a reason like `customer-did-not-answer`.
- **Detected Voicemail + Have a Message**: Your assistant leaves the recorded message, and the call ends with a reason like `voicemail`.

## **Testing and Next Steps**

1. **Make a Test Call**: Dial a known voicemail number and watch how quickly (and accurately) your VAPI Assistant identifies the machine.
2. **Tweak Settings**: Adjust your timeout and threshold values based on real-world performance.
3. **Repeat**: Keep testing until you’re confident your configuration is catching voicemail reliably without cutting off real people.

By following these steps, you’ll save time, improve call-handling efficiency, and ensure your system feels more professional. If you need to fine-tune or add new features later, you can always revisit these settings and make quick adjustments.

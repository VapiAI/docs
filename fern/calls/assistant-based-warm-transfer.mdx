## Overview

Assistant-based warm transfer uses a dedicated AI assistant to handle the transfer process. You control how this assistant behaves through prompts and configuration. The assistant has access to the previous customer conversation and follows your instructions to decide whether to complete or cancel the transfer.

**In this guide, you'll learn to:**
- Configure transfer assistants with custom prompts
- Control how the assistant interacts with operators
- Handle failed transfer scenarios

## How it works

When using assistant-based warm transfer:

1. **Customer requests transfer** - The original assistant initiates the transfer
2. **Customer placed on hold** - Customer hears hold music while transfer is attempted
3. **Transfer assistant calls operator** - A dedicated assistant is placed on the call to the destination
4. **Assistant follows your prompts** - The transfer assistant has access to the previous conversation context and follows your configured behavior
5. **Transfer decision** - Based on the interaction, the assistant either:
   - **Completes transfer** (`transferSuccessful`) - Merges the calls and exits
   - **Cancels transfer** (`transferCancel`) - Returns the customer to the original assistant

**Transfer cancellation occurs when:**
- `maxDurationSeconds` is reached
- Operator doesn't answer
- Voicemail is detected (based on your prompt configuration)
- Any condition you define in your prompts

## Configuration

<Note>
The `function.name` property identifies your transfer tool. Use this name when instructing your assistant to perform transfers in system prompts.
</Note>

### Transfer assistant properties

<ParamField path="transferAssistant.firstMessage" type="string">
  The initial message spoken by the transfer assistant when the operator answers
</ParamField>

<ParamField path="transferAssistant.maxDurationSeconds" type="number">
  Maximum duration in seconds for the operator call. The transfer is automatically cancelled if this limit is reached.
</ParamField>

<ParamField path="transferAssistant.silenceTimeoutSeconds" type="number" default={30}>

</ParamField>

## Built-in tools

The transfer assistant has access to two built-in tools:

<Note>
You can configure the transfer assistant to perform various tasks before making a decision, such as:
- Informing the operator about the customer's needs
- Asking the operator specific questions
- Following custom business logic you define in the prompts
</Note>

### transferSuccessful

Completes the transfer by:
- Merging the customer and operator calls
- Removing the transfer assistant from the call
- Connecting the parties directly

### transferCancel

Cancels the transfer by:
- Disconnecting from the operator
- Returning the customer to the original assistant
- Optionally playing a fallback message

## Additional examples

### Handling operator interactions

The transfer assistant can be configured to handle various operator responses:

## Best practices

<Tip>
**First message**: Keep it brief and state the purpose clearly.
</Tip>

<Note>
**Timeout duration**: Set `maxDurationSeconds` between 60-120 seconds. This limits how long the operator call can last before automatic cancellation.
</Note>

<Warning>
**System prompts**: Configure your prompts to handle voicemail detection, busy signals, and operator unavailability.
</Warning>

### System prompt configuration

Configure your transfer assistant to:
- **Detect voicemail** - Recognize automated messages and call `transferCancel`
- **Verify human presence** - Confirm a person answered before proceeding
- **Provide context** - Explain the customer's situation based on your knowledge
- **Handle rejections** - Define behavior when operators decline
- **Manage timing** - Complete interactions before `maxDurationSeconds`

## Limitations

<Info>
- Requires `warm-transfer-experimental` mode
- Only works with Twilio phone numbers
- Calls are limited by `maxDurationSeconds` to prevent indefinite duration
- Built-in tools (`transferSuccessful`, `transferCancel`) are predefined and cannot be removed
- The transfer assistant has access to the previous conversation context
</Info>

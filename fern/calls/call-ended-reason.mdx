#### Pipeline and LLM

These relate to issues within the AI processing pipeline or the Large Language Models (LLMs) used for understanding and generating text:

- `call.in-progress.error-vapifault-*`: Various error codes indicate specific failures within the processing pipeline, such as function execution, LLM responses, or external service integration. Examples include OpenAI, Azure OpenAI, Together AI, and several other LLMs or voice providers.
- `call.in-progress.error-providerfault-*`: Similar to `call.in-progress.error-vapifault-*`. However, these error codes are surfaced when Vapi receives an error that has occured on the provider's side. Examples include internal server errors, or service unavailability.
- `pipeline-error-*`: Similar to `call.in-progress.error-vapifault-*`. However, these error codes are surfaced when you are using your own provider keys.
- `pipeline-no-available-llm-model`: No suitable LLM was available to process the request. Previously `pipeline-no-available-model`.
- `call.in-progress.error-pipeline-no-available-llm-model`: No suitable LLM was available to process the request during the call.

#### Phone Calls and Connectivity

- `customer-busy`: The customer's line was busy.
- `customer-ended-call`: The customer (end human user) ended the call for both inbound and outbound calls.
- `customer-did-not-answer`: The customer didn't answer the call. If you're looking to build a use case where you need the bot to talk to automated IVRs, set `assistant.voicemailDetectionEnabled=false`.
- `customer-did-not-give-microphone-permission`: The user didn't grant the necessary microphone access for the call.
- `call.in-progress.error-assistant-did-not-receive-customer-audio`: Similar to `customer-did-not-give-microphone-permission`, but more generalized to situations where no customer audio was received.
- `phone-call-provider-closed-websocket`: The connection with the call provider was unexpectedly closed.
- `phone-call-provider-bypass-enabled-but-no-call-received`: The phone call provider bypass was enabled but no call was received.

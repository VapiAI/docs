When you're running outbound voice agents, voicemails are a reality — but wasting time or missing opportunities because of them shouldn't be.

**Vapi's updated voicemail detection system** gives you faster, smarter, and more flexible handling of voicemail events, so you can keep your calls efficient, responsive, and professional.

## **Why Voicemail Detection Matters**

- **Save time** by avoiding long waits on unanswered calls.
- **Optimize costs** by cutting down on wasted minutes.
- **Improve UX** by ensuring your agent behaves naturally when encountering voicemail greetings.
- **Boost response rates** by leaving cleaner, more intentional voicemail messages.

## **Today's Detection Options**

You can now choose between several detection methods — but not all are created equal:

| Detection Method | Strengths | Weaknesses | Recommendation |
| :--------------- | :-------- | :--------- | :------------- |
| **Vapi (Recommended)** | Fast, accurate, gracefully handles interruptions | None significant | ✅ Strongly recommended |
| **Google** | Very good accuracy, reliable | Slightly longer detection time than Vapi | ✅ Recommended |
| **OpenAI** | High accuracy, flexible phrasing | Higher cost | ✅ Good option if budget allows |
| **Twilio** (legacy) | Very fast machine beep detection | Prone to false positives | ⚠️ Use only in special cases |
| **Vapi Voicemail Tool** (legacy) | Keyword-based detection in transcription | Slow, context-dependent | ⚠️ Use only if needed |

## **New Default Behavior: Vapi Voicemail Detection**

With **Vapi Voicemail Detection**, your assistant will:

- **Detect voicemail faster** (often within the first few seconds of the call).
- **Handle real-time pickups** gracefully — if a human picks up mid-voicemail, the agent will switch back naturally.
- **Interrupt the bot's first message** appropriately if voicemail is detected mid-sentence.
- **Minimize false positives** by combining audio analysis (beeps) and transcription intelligence.

All three providers — **Vapi, Google, and OpenAI** — now support **interruption handling** and **false positive protection**.

## **How to Configure It**

On the **Assistants tab**, you'll find an updated Voicemail Detection section:

You can choose your preferred detection provider:
- **Vapi (default)**
- **Google**
- **OpenAI**
- **Twilio**
- **Tool-based (legacy)**

## **Advanced Configuration Options**

For each detection method, you can fine-tune the following parameters:

| Parameter | Description |
| :-------- | :---------- |
| **<a href="https://docs.vapi.ai/api-reference/assistants/create#request.body.voicemailDetection.vapi.backoffPlan.startAtSeconds" target="_blank">Initial Detection Delay</a>** | How long to wait (in seconds) before starting voicemail detection |
| **<a href="https://docs.vapi.ai/api-reference/assistants/create#request.body.voicemailDetection.vapi.backoffPlan.frequencySeconds" target="_blank">Detection Retry Interval</a>** | How frequently to check for voicemail (in seconds) |
| **<a href="https://docs.vapi.ai/api-reference/assistants/create#request.body.voicemailDetection.vapi.backoffPlan.maxRetries" target="_blank">Max Detection Retries</a>** | Maximum number of detection attempts before stopping |
| **<a href="https://docs.vapi.ai/api-reference/assistants/create#request.body.voicemailDetection.vapi.beepMaxAwaitSeconds" target="_blank">Max Voicemail Message Wait</a>** | Maximum time to wait before leaving a message (even without beep detection) |

These settings allow you to balance:
- **Speed** (how quickly voicemail is detected)
- **Accuracy** (reducing false positives)
- **Cost** (fewer detection attempts = lower API costs)

## **How Vapi Detection Works**

Vapi's detection engine combines:
- **Gemini model-based detection** (fast and highly accurate on common voicemail phrasing)
- **Twilio beep detection** (optional, for faster reaction to voicemail system beeps)
- **Real-time call monitoring** to react instantly if a human unexpectedly picks up
- **Continuous voicemail polling** during early call stages (detecting voicemail faster without waiting for a full timeout)

This hybrid approach means **less call delay, fewer mistakes, and a much more natural call experience.**

By switching to Vapi's new detection system, you'll avoid the common pitfalls of older voicemail detection, while creating a **faster, smarter, and more professional experience** for your users.

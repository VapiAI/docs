## Before you start

Prerequisites:
- Access to a server or cloud function that can receive requests from Vapi

## Overview

Dynamic call transfers let your assistant transfer calls to different destinations (phone numbers, SIP, or other assistants) based on real-time context. This guide shows you how to set up a custom transfer tool, connect it to your assistant, handle transfer requests with your server, and respond with the right destination or error.

<Steps>
  <Step title="Create a custom transfer tool">
    Create a transfer tool with an empty `destinations` array. This acts as a placeholder so you can define destinations dynamically at runtime.
    
    ```bash
    curl -X POST https://api.vapi.ai/tool \
         -H "Authorization: Bearer insert-private-key-here" \
         -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
         -d '{
      "type": "transferCall",
      "destinations": [],
      "function": {
        "name": "dynamicDestinationTransferCall"
      }
    }'
    ```
  </Step>

  <Step title="Link the tool to your assistant">
    After creating the tool, link it to your assistant. This enables the assistant to trigger the tool during calls.
  </Step>

  <Step title="Configure the server event">
    In your assistant settings, select the `transfer-destination-request` server event. This event sends a webhook to your server whenever a transfer is requested, so you can dynamically determine the destination.
  </Step>

  <Step title="Set up your server to handle transfer requests">
    Update your assistant's server URL to point to your server. Your server will receive a webhook with call details whenever a transfer is triggered, and should respond with the appropriate destination or an error.
  </Step>

  <Step title="Trigger the tool and process requests">
    Use a prompt like this to trigger the transfer tool:
    
    ```
    [TASK]
    trigger the dynamicDestinationTransferCall tool
    ```
    
    When triggered, the assistant sends a `transfer-destination-request` webhook to your server. The webhook includes call details, transcripts, and messages.
    
    **Sample request payload:**
    ```json
    {
      "type": "transfer-destination-request",
      "artifact": {
        "messages": [...],
        "transcript": "Hello, how can I help you?",
        "messagesOpenAIFormatted": [...]
      },
      "assistant": { "id": "assistant123" },
      "phoneNumber": "+14155552671",
      "customer": { "id": "customer456" },
      "call": { "id": "call789", "status": "ongoing" }
    }
    ```
  </Step>

  <Step title="Respond to transfer requests">
    Your server should respond with either a valid `destination` or an `error`.
    
    #### Number destination example
    ```json
    {
      "destination": {
        "type": "number",
        "message": "Connecting you to our support line.",
        "number": "+14155552671",
        "numberE164CheckEnabled": true,
        "callerId": "+14155551234",
        "extension": "101"
      }
    }
    ```
    
    #### SIP destination example
    ```json
    {
      "destination": {
        "type": "sip",
        "message": "Connecting your call via SIP.",
        "sipUri": "sip:customer-support@domain.com",
        "sipHeaders": {
          "X-Custom-Header": "value"
        }
      }
    }
    ```
    
    #### Error response example
    ```json
    {
      "error": "Invalid destination specified."
    }
    ```
    Every response must include either a `destination` or an `error` to indicate the outcome of the transfer request.
  </Step>
</Steps>

## Conclusion

Dynamic call transfers empower your assistant to route calls efficiently based on real-time data. By implementing this flow, you can ensure seamless interactions and provide a better experience for your users.

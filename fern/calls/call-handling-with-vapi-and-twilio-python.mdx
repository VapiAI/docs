title: Call Handling with Vapi and Twilio (Python)
slug: calls/call-handling-with-vapi-and-twilio-python
---

This document explains how to implement a Python Flask solution for handling a scenario where a user is on hold while the system attempts to connect them to a specialist. If the specialist does not pick up within X seconds or if the call hits voicemail, we take an alternate action (like playing an announcement or scheduling an appointment). This solution integrates Vapi.ai for AI-driven conversations and Twilio for call bridging.

## Problem

Vapi.ai does not provide a built-in way to keep the user on hold, dial a specialist, and handle cases where the specialist is unavailable. We want:

1. The user already talking to the AI (Vapi).
2. The AI offers to connect them to a specialist.
3. The user is placed on hold or in a conference room.
4. We dial the specialist to join.
5. If the specialist answers, everyone is merged.
6. If the specialist does not answer (within X seconds or goes to voicemail), we want to either announce "Specialist not available" or schedule an appointment.

## Solution

1. An inbound call arrives from Vapi or from the user directly.
2. We store its details (e.g., Twilio CallSid).
3. We send TwiML (or instructions) to put the user in a Twilio conference (on hold).
4. We place a second call to the specialist, also directed to join the same conference.
5. If the specialist picks up, Twilio merges the calls.
6. If not, we handle the no-answer event by playing a message or returning control to the AI for scheduling.

## Steps to Solve the Problem

1. **Receive Inbound Call**

   - Twilio posts data to your `/inbound_call`.
   - You store the call reference.
   - You might also invoke Vapi for initial AI instructions.

2. **Prompt User via Vapi**

   - The user decides whether they want the specialist.
   - If yes, you call an endpoint (e.g., `/connect`).

3. **Create/Join Conference**

   - In `/connect`, you update the inbound call to go into a conference route.
   - The user is effectively on hold.

4. **Dial Specialist**

   - You create a second call leg to the specialist's phone.
   - A `statusCallback` can detect no-answer or voicemail.

5. **Detect Unanswered**

   - If Twilio sees a no-answer or failure, your callback logic plays an announcement or signals the AI to schedule an appointment.

6. **Merge or Exit**

   - If the specialist answers, they join the user.
   - If not, the user is taken off hold and the call ends or goes back to AI.

7. **Use Ephemeral Call (Optional)**
   - If you need an in-conference announcement, create a short-lived Twilio call that `<Say>` the message to everyone, then ends the conference.

## Code Example

Below is a Python Flask implementation for On-Hold Specialist Transfer with Vapi and Twilio, including improvements for specialist confirmation and voicemail detection.

1. **Flask Setup and Environment**

```python
import os
import requests
from flask import Flask, Response, request
from twilio.rest import Client
from twilio.twiml.voice_response import Dial, VoiceResponse
from dotenv import load_dotenv

# Load environment variables from .env file
load_dotenv()

app = Flask(__name__)

# Twilio Configuration
TWILIO_ACCOUNT_SID = os.getenv("TWILIO_ACCOUNT_SID", "your_twilio_account_sid")
TWILIO_AUTH_TOKEN = os.getenv("TWILIO_AUTH_TOKEN", "your_twilio_auth_token")
FROM_NUMBER = os.getenv("FROM_NUMBER", "+15551234567")  # Twilio number
TO_NUMBER = os.getenv("TO_NUMBER", "+15557654321")  # Specialist's number

# Vapi Configuration
VAPI_BASE_URL = os.getenv("VAPI_BASE_URL", "https://api.vapi.ai")
PHONE_NUMBER_ID = os.getenv("PHONE_NUMBER_ID", "your_vapi_phone_number_id")
ASSISTANT_ID = os.getenv("ASSISTANT_ID", "your_vapi_assistant_id")
PRIVATE_API_KEY = os.getenv("PRIVATE_API_KEY", "your_vapi_private_api_key")

# Create a Twilio client
client = Client(TWILIO_ACCOUNT_SID, TWILIO_AUTH_TOKEN)

# We'll store the inbound call SID here for simplicity
global_call_sid = ""
```

2. **`/inbound_call` - Handling the Inbound Call**

```python
@app.route("/inbound_call", methods=["POST"])
def inbound_call():
    """
    Handle the inbound call from Twilio.
    Store the call SID and call Vapi.ai to get initial TwiML.
    """
    try:
        global global_call_sid
        global_call_sid = request.form.get("CallSid")
        caller = request.form.get("Caller")

        print(f"Inbound call received: CallSid={global_call_sid}, Caller={caller}")
        print(f"Request form data: {request.form}")

        # Call Vapi.ai to get initial TwiML
        response = requests.post(
            f"{VAPI_BASE_URL}/call",
            json={
                "phoneNumberId": PHONE_NUMBER_ID,
                "phoneCallProviderBypassEnabled": True,
                "customer": {"number": caller},
                "assistantId": ASSISTANT_ID,
            },
            headers={
                "Authorization": f"Bearer {PRIVATE_API_KEY}",
                "Content-Type": "application/json",
            },
        )

        returned_twiml = response.json()["phoneCallProviderDetails"]["twiml"]
        print(f"Vapi returned TwiML: {returned_twiml}")
        return Response(returned_twiml, mimetype="text/xml")
    except Exception as e:
        print(f"Error in inbound_call: {str(e)}")
        return Response("Internal Server Error", status=500)
```

3. **`/connect` - Putting User on Hold and Dialing Specialist**

```python
@app.route("/connect", methods=["POST"])
def connect():
    """
    Put the user on hold and dial the specialist.
    """
    try:
        # Get the base URL
        if request.headers.get("X-Forwarded-Proto") != "https":
            raise Exception("Hey there! Just a heads up Twilio services require HTTPS for security reasons. Make sure your server URL starts with 'https://' instead of 'http://'")
        
        base_url = f"https://{request.host}"
        conference_url = f"{base_url}/conference"
        specialist_prompt_url = f"{base_url}/specialist-prompt"

        # 1) Update inbound call to fetch TwiML from /conference
        client.calls(global_call_sid).update(url=conference_url, method="POST")

        # 2) Dial the specialist with prompt instead of direct conference
        status_callback_url = f"{base_url}/participant-status"

        client.calls.create(
            to=TO_NUMBER,
            from_=FROM_NUMBER,
            url=specialist_prompt_url,  # Using prompt endpoint for confirmation
            method="POST",
            status_callback=status_callback_url,
            status_callback_method="POST",
        )

        return {"status": "Specialist call initiated"}, 200
    except Exception as e:
        print(f"Error in connect: {str(e)}")
        return {"error": "Failed to connect specialist"}, 500
```

4. **`/conference` - Placing Callers Into a Conference**

```python
@app.route("/conference", methods=["POST"])
def conference():
    """
    Place callers into a conference.
    """
    call_sid = request.form.get("CallSid", "")
    print(f"Conference endpoint called for CallSid: {call_sid}")
    
    response = VoiceResponse()
    
    # Put the caller(s) into a conference
    dial = Dial()
    dial.conference(
        "my_conference_room",
        start_conference_on_enter=True,
        end_conference_on_exit=True,
    )
    response.append(dial)
    
    return Response(str(response), mimetype="text/xml")
```

5. **`/participant-status` - Handling No-Answer or Busy**

```python
@app.route("/participant-status", methods=["POST"])
def participant_status():
    """
    Handle no-answer or busy scenarios.
    This is called by Twilio when the specialist call status changes.
    """
    call_sid = request.form.get("CallSid", "")
    call_status = request.form.get("CallStatus", "")
    call_duration = request.form.get("CallDuration", "")
    
    print(f"Participant status update: CallSid={call_sid}, Status={call_status}, Duration={call_duration}")
    
    # Check for voicemail by looking at call duration - if it's very short but "completed"
    # it might be a voicemail system that answered
    if call_status == "completed" and call_duration and int(call_duration) < 5:
        print(f"Call was very short ({call_duration}s), likely voicemail. Treating as no-answer.")
        call_status = "no-answer"
    
    if call_status in ["no-answer", "busy", "failed"]:
        print(f"Specialist did not pick up: {call_status}")
        
        # Create an ephemeral call to announce the specialist is unavailable
        try:
            if request.headers.get("X-Forwarded-Proto") != "https":
                raise Exception("Hey there! Just a heads up Twilio services require HTTPS for security reasons. Make sure your server URL starts with 'https://' instead of 'http://'")
            
            base_url = f"https://{request.host}"
            announce_url = f"{base_url}/announce"
            
            # Create an ephemeral call to join the conference and make an announcement
            announce_call = client.calls.create(
                to=FROM_NUMBER,  # This is just a placeholder, the call will join the conference
                from_=FROM_NUMBER,
                url=announce_url,
                method="POST",
            )
            print(f"Created announcement call with SID: {announce_call.sid}")
        except Exception as e:
            print(f"Error creating announcement call: {str(e)}")
    
    return "", 200
```

6. **`/announce` - Ephemeral Announcement**

```python
@app.route("/announce", methods=["POST"])
def announce():
    """
    Create an ephemeral announcement in the conference.
    """
    response = VoiceResponse()
    response.say("Specialist is not available. The transfer wasn't successful.")
    
    # Join the conference, then end it
    dial = Dial()
    dial.conference(
        "my_conference_room",
        start_conference_on_enter=True,
        end_conference_on_exit=True,
    )
    response.append(dial)
    
    return Response(str(response), mimetype="text/xml")
```

7. **Specialist Prompt Endpoints (Improved Voicemail Handling)**

```python
@app.route("/specialist-prompt", methods=["POST"])
def specialist_prompt():
    """
    Prompt the specialist to press 1 to accept the call.
    """
    # Check if this is a retry
    attempt = request.args.get("attempt", "1")
    
    response = VoiceResponse()
    response.say("Someone is waiting to speak with you. Press 1 to accept this call.")
    
    # Wait for keypress with 3 second timeout
    with response.gather(
        num_digits=1, action="/specialist-accept", timeout=3
    ) as gather:
        gather.say("Press 1 now to connect.")
    
    # If no input after timeout
    if attempt == "1":
        # Try once more
        response.redirect("/specialist-prompt?attempt=2")
    else:
        # Second attempt failed, handle as declined
        response.redirect("/specialist-declined")
    
    return Response(str(response), mimetype="text/xml")

@app.route("/specialist-accept", methods=["POST"])
def specialist_accept():
    """
    Handle specialist accepting the call by pressing 1.
    """
    digits = request.form.get("Digits", "")
    
    response = VoiceResponse()
    
    if digits == "1":
        response.say("Thank you. Connecting you now.")
        
        # Join the conference
        dial = Dial()
        dial.conference(
            "my_conference_room",
            start_conference_on_enter=True,
            end_conference_on_exit=True,
        )
        response.append(dial)
    else:
        # If they pressed something other than 1
        response.say("Invalid input. Goodbye.")
        response.hangup()
    
    return Response(str(response), mimetype="text/xml")

@app.route("/specialist-declined", methods=["POST"])
def specialist_declined():
    """
    Handle specialist declining the call (not pressing 1 after two attempts).
    """
    # Get the base URL
    if request.headers.get("X-Forwarded-Proto") != "https":
        raise Exception("Hey there! Just a heads up Twilio services require HTTPS for security reasons. Make sure your server URL starts with 'https://' instead of 'http://'")
    
    base_url = f"https://{request.host}"
    announce_url = f"{base_url}/announce"
    
    # Create an ephemeral call to join the conference and make an announcement
    try:
        client.calls.create(
            to=FROM_NUMBER,  # This is just a placeholder, the call will join the conference
            from_=FROM_NUMBER,
            url=announce_url,
            method="POST",
        )
    except Exception as e:
        print(f"Error creating announcement call: {str(e)}")
    
    # Hang up the specialist call
    response = VoiceResponse()
    response.say("Thank you. Goodbye.")
    response.hangup()
    
    return Response(str(response), mimetype="text/xml")
```

8. **Starting the Server**

```python
if __name__ == "__main__":
    app.run(host="0.0.0.0", port=3000)
```

## How to Test

1. **Environment Variables**  
   Create a `.env` file with the following variables:
   ```
   TWILIO_ACCOUNT_SID=your_twilio_account_sid
   TWILIO_AUTH_TOKEN=your_twilio_auth_token
   FROM_NUMBER=+15551234567
   TO_NUMBER=+15557654321
   VAPI_BASE_URL=https://api.vapi.ai
   PHONE_NUMBER_ID=your_vapi_phone_number_id
   ASSISTANT_ID=your_vapi_assistant_id
   PRIVATE_API_KEY=your_vapi_private_api_key
   NGROK_AUTH_TOKEN=your_ngrok_auth_token
   ```

2. **Install Dependencies**
   ```bash
   pip install flask requests twilio python-dotenv ngrok
   ```

3. **Expose Your Server**

   - Use ngrok to create a public URL to port 3000:
     ```python
     # ngrok_tunnel.py
     import os
     import ngrok
     from dotenv import load_dotenv

     load_dotenv()
     NGROK_AUTH_TOKEN = os.getenv("NGROK_AUTH_TOKEN")
     listener = ngrok.forward(3000, authtoken=NGROK_AUTH_TOKEN)
     print(" * ngrok tunnel:", listener.url())
     print(" * Use this URL in your Vapi webhook configuration and Twilio voice webhook URL")
     print(" * For example, your inbound call webhook would be:", f"{listener.url()}/inbound_call")
     input("Press Enter to exit...\n")
     ```

   - Run the ngrok tunnel:
     ```bash
     python ngrok_tunnel.py
     ```

   - Configure your Twilio phone number to call `/inbound_call` when a call comes in.

4. **Start the Flask Server**
   ```bash
   python vapi_twilio_transfer.py
   ```

5. **Place a Real Call**

   - Dial your Twilio number from a phone.
   - Twilio hits `/inbound_call`, and runs Vapi logic.
   - Trigger `/connect` to conference the user and dial the specialist.
   - If the specialist answers and presses 1, they join the same conference.
   - If they don't press 1 or never answer, Twilio eventually calls `/participant-status`.

## Improvements Over Basic Implementation

1. **Specialist Confirmation**
   - When the specialist is called, they must press 1 to accept the call
   - This prevents voicemail systems from being treated as answered calls
   - If no key is pressed within 3 seconds, the prompt is repeated once
   - If still no response, the call is considered declined

2. **Voicemail Detection**
   - Added logic to detect voicemail by checking call duration
   - If a call is "completed" but lasted less than 5 seconds, it's likely a voicemail system
   - In this case, it's treated as a "no-answer" scenario

3. **Detailed Logging**
   - Added comprehensive logging throughout the application
   - Each endpoint logs the request data it receives and the responses it sends
   - This helps with debugging and understanding the call flow

## Notes & Limitations

1. **Voicemail Detection**  
   Our implementation uses call duration to detect voicemail, but this is not foolproof. If a specialist answers but hangs up quickly, it might be mistaken for voicemail. You can adjust the 5-second threshold in the `/participant-status` endpoint based on your needs.

2. **Specialist Prompt Timing**  
   The 3-second timeout for specialist response might be too short or too long depending on your use case. Adjust the timeout in the `/specialist-prompt` endpoint as needed.

3. **Concurrent Calls**  
   Multiple calls at once require storing separate `CallSid`s or similar references. The current implementation uses a global variable which only works for one call at a time.

4. **Conference Behavior**  
   `start_conference_on_enter=True` merges participants immediately; `end_conference_on_exit=True` ends the conference when that participant leaves. Adjust these parameters based on your specific requirements.

5. **Flask in Production**  
   For production use, consider using a WSGI server like Gunicorn instead of Flask's built-in development server.

With these steps and code, you can integrate Vapi Assistant while using Twilio's conferencing features to hold, dial out to a specialist, and handle an unanswered or unavailable specialist scenario, with improved handling for voicemail detection.

subtitle: Let's build a pizza ordering assistant for our website.

In this example, we'll be using the [Web SDK](https://github.com/VapiAI/web) to create an assistant that can take a pizza order. Since all the [Client SDKs](/sdks) have equivalent functionality, you can use this example as a guide for any Vapi client.

We want to add a button to the page to start a call, update our UI with the call status, and display what the user's saying while they say it. When the user mentions a topping, we should add it to the pizza. When they're done, we should redirect them to checkout.

<Steps>
  <Step title="Create an assistant">
    We'll start by taking a look at the [Assistant API
    reference](/api-reference/assistants/create-assistant) and define our
    assistant:

    ```json
    {
      "model": {
        "provider": "openai",
        "model": "gpt-4",
        "messages": [
          {
              "role": "system",
              "content": "You're a pizza ordering assistant. The user will ask for toppings, you'll add them. When they're done, you'll redirect them to checkout."
          }
        ],
        "functions": [
          {
            "name": "addTopping",
            "description": "Used to add a topping to the pizza.",
            "parameters": {
              "type": "object",
              "properties": {
                "topping": {
                  "type": "string",
                  "description": "The name of the topping. For example, 'pepperoni'."
                }
              }
            }
          },
           {
            "name": "goToCheckout",
            "description": "Redirects the user to checkout and order their pizza.",
            "parameters": {"type": "object", "properties": {}}
          }
        ]
      },
      "firstMessage": "Hi, I'm the pizza ordering assistant. What toppings would you like?",
    }
    ```
    Let's break this down:
    - `model` - We're using the OpenAI GPT-4 model, which is better at function calling.
    - `messages` - We're defining the assistant's instructions for how to run the call.
    - `functions` - We're providing a addTopping function with a topping parameter. The assistant can call this during the conversation to add a topping. We're also adding goToCheckout, with an empty parameters object. The assistant can call this to redirect the user to checkout.
    - `firstMessage` - This is the first message the assistant will say when the user starts the call.

    We'll then make a POST request to the [Create Assistant](/api-reference/assistants/create-assistant) endpoint to create the assistant.

  </Step>
  <Step title="Set up the Web SDK">
    We'll follow the `README` for the [Web SDK](https://github.com/VapiAI/web) to get it installed.

    We'll then get our **Public Key** from the [Vapi Dashboard](https://dashboard.vapi.ai) and initialize the SDK:

    ```js
    import Vapi from '@vapi-ai/web';

    const vapi = new Vapi('your-web-token');
    ```

  </Step>
  <Step title="Add the call buttons">
    We'll add a button to the page that starts the call when clicked:

    ```html
    <button id="start-call">Start Call</button>
    <button id="stop-call">Stop Call</button>
    ```

    ```js
    const startCallButton = document.getElementById('start-call');

    startCallButton.addEventListener('click', async () => {
      await vapi.start('your-assistant-id');
    });

    const stopCallButton = document.getElementById('stop-call');

    stopCallButton.addEventListener('click', async () => {
      await vapi.stop();
    });
    ```

  </Step>
  <Step title="Handle call status events">
    ```js
    vapi.on('call-start', () => {
      // Update UI to show that the call has started
    });

    vapi.on('call-end', () => {
      // Update UI to show that the call has ended
    });
    ```

  </Step>

<Step title="Handle speaking events">
  ```js
  vapi.on('speech-start', () => {
    // Update UI to show that the assistant is speaking
  });

vapi.on('speech-end', () => {
// Update UI to show that the assistant is done speaking
});

````

</Step>

<Step title="Handle transcription events">
  All messages send to the [Server URL](/server-url), including `transcript` and `function-call` messages, are also sent to the client as `message` events. We'll need to check the `type` of the message to see what type it is.

```js
vapi.on("message", (msg) => {
  if (msg.type !== "transcript") return;

  if (msg.transcriptType === "partial") {
    // Update UI to show the live partial transcript
  }

  if (msg.transcriptType === "final") {
    // Update UI to show the final transcript
  }
});
````

</Step>

<Step title="Handle function call events">
```javascript
vapi.on('message', (msg) => {
  if (msg.type !== "function-call") return;

if (msg.functionCall.name === "addTopping") {
const topping = msg.functionCall.parameters.topping;
// Add the topping to the pizza
}

if (msg.functionCall.name === "goToCheckout") {
// Redirect the user to checkout
}
});

```
</Step>
<Step title="Order your pizza!">
You should now have a working pizza ordering assistant! 🍕

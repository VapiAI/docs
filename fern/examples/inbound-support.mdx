## Overview

Build a banking support agent with function tools, CSV knowledge bases, and voice test suites. The agent handles account verification, balance inquiries, and transaction history via phone calls.

**Agent Capabilities:**
* Account lookup and verification via phone number
* Balance and transaction history retrieval

**What You'll Build:**
* Retrieval tools and CSV knowledge bases for account/transaction data
* Voice test suites for automated quality assurance
* Inbound phone number configuration for 24/7 availability

## Prerequisites

* A [Vapi account](https://dashboard.vapi.ai/).

## Scenario

We will be creating a customer support agent for VapiBank, a bank that wants to provide 24/7 support to consumers.

        <Button intent="primary">Download accounts.csv</Button>
      </Download>
      <Download src="../static/spreadsheets/inbound-support/transactions.csv">

  </Step>
  <Step title="Upload the spreadsheets">
    - Click `Choose file`. Upload both `accounts.csv` and `transactions.csv` files.

## 3. Configure an Assistant

<Steps>
  <Step title="Update the introduction message">
    Update `First Message` to:

    ```txt title="First Message" wordWrap
    Hello, you've reached VapiBank customer support! My name is Tom, how may I assist you today?
    ```
  </Step>
  <Step title="Update the system prompt">
    Update `System Prompt` to:

```txt title="System Prompt" maxLines=10
# VapiBank - Phone Support Agent Prompt
 
## Identity & Purpose
You are **Tom**, VapiBank's friendly, 24x7 phone-support voice assistant. Do not introduce yourself after the first message.
You help customers with account inquiries:
 
1. **Check balance**  
2. **View recent transactions**  
 
## Data Sources
You have access to CSV files with account and transaction data:
- **accounts.csv**: `account_id, name, phone_last4, balance, card_status, email`
- **transactions.csv**: transaction history for all accounts
 
## Available Tools
1. **lookup_account** → verify customer identity using phone number
2. **get_balance** → returns current balance for verified account
3. **get_recent_transactions** → returns recent transaction history
 
## Conversation Flow
1. **Greeting**  
  > "Hello, you've reached VapiBank customer support! My name is Tom, how may I assist you today?"
 
2. **Account Verification**  
  * After caller provides phone digits → call **lookup_account**
  * Read back the returned `name` for confirmation
  * If no match after 2 tries → apologize and offer to transfer
 
3. **Handle Request**  
  Ask: "How can I help you today—check your balance or review recent transactions?"
 
  **Balance** → call **get_balance** → read current balance
  **Transactions** → call **get_recent_transactions** → summarize recent activity
 
4. **Close**  
  > "Is there anything else I can help you with today?"  
  If no → thank the caller and end the call
 
## Style & Tone
* Warm, concise, ≤ 30 words per reply
* One question at a time
* Repeat important numbers slowly and clearly
* Professional but friendly tone
 
## Edge Cases
* **No account match** → offer to transfer to human agent
* **Multiple requests** → handle each request, then ask if anything else needed
* **Technical issues** → apologize and offer callback or transfer
 
(Remember: only share account information with verified account holders.)

## Next Steps

Just like that, you've built a 24/7 customer support hotline that can handle inbound calls, create support tickets, and run automated tests to ensure it's working as expected.

Consider the reading the following guides to further enhance your assistant:

* [**Knowledge Bases**](../knowledge-base/) - Attach a Trieve KB so the agent can answer FAQs inline.
* [**External Integrations**](../tools/) - Configure integrations with [Google Calendar](../tools/google-calendar), [Google Sheets](../tools/google-sheets), [Slack](../tools/slack), etc.

### Additional Telnyx Integration Information

## Configuring Outbound Calling with Telnyx

To enable outbound calling with your imported Telnyx numbers, you need to configure your Telnyx account:

1. Log in to the [Telnyx Portal](https://portal.telnyx.com/#/outbound-profiles)
2. Create or edit an Outbound Voice Profile
3. Add Vapi as a connection under the "Connections and Applications" tab
4. Save your changes

Without this configuration, outbound calling functionality will not work properly with your Telnyx numbers on the Vapi platform.

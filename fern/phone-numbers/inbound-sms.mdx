## Overview

Vapi agents can automatically initiate a conversation when your number receives an inbound SMS.

<Warning>
  Inbound SMS is currently supported only for **Twilio US numbers** with **SMS enabled**, and only for **US ↔ US** messaging. Messages sent from or to non‑US numbers are not supported.
</Warning>

When enabled, Vapi configures the Twilio Messaging webhook on your number so inbound texts start a session with your agent.

</Tip>

## Requirements

- **Twilio number in the US**
- **SMS capability enabled** on that number (in Twilio and in Vapi)
- **US-to-US** messaging only

## Set up from the dashboard

<Steps>
  <Step title="Import your Twilio number">
    Bring your number into Vapi so we can manage voice and messaging webhooks.
    
    See: [Import number from Twilio](/phone-numbers/import-twilio)
  </Step>
  <Step title="Enable SMS for the number">
    In the number settings, turn on the **SMS** option. Vapi will set the Twilio Messaging webhook to route inbound texts to your agent.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Attach your agent (optional)">
    Assign the assistant you want handling conversations for this number. Inbound texts will start a session with that assistant.
  </Step>
</Steps>

## Set up via API

You can enable inbound SMS while creating or updating a Twilio phone number by setting `smsEnabled: true`.

### Create or import a Twilio number with SMS enabled

<EndpointRequestSnippet endpoint='POST /phone-number' />

Key fields:

- **provider**: `twilio`
- **smsEnabled**: `true` (lets Vapi manage Twilio Messaging webhooks)

<ParamField path="smsEnabled" type="boolean" default="true">
  Controls whether Vapi configures the Twilio Messaging webhook during import/creation. If `false`, Vapi leaves your Twilio messaging URL unchanged.
</ParamField>

### Enable SMS on an existing number

<EndpointRequestSnippet endpoint='PATCH /phone-number/{id}' />

Update your number to set `smsEnabled: true` if it was previously disabled.

## Notes and limitations

- **US-only**: Both sender and recipient must be US numbers.
- **Twilio only**: Other telephony providers are not supported for inbound SMS at this time.
- **Webhooks**: With `smsEnabled: true`, Vapi manages the Twilio Messaging webhook for you.

For full endpoint details, see the [OpenAPI reference](https://api.vapi.ai/api-json).

[**Tools**](/api-reference/tools/create) allow your assistant to take actions beyond just conversation. They enable your assistant to perform tasks like transferring calls, accessing external data, or triggering actions in your application. Tools can be either built-in default tools provided by Vapi or custom tools that you create.

There are three types of tools available:

1. **Default Tools**: Built-in functions provided by Vapi for common operations like call transfers and control.
2. **Custom Tools**: Your own functions that can be called by the assistant to interact with your systems.
3. **Integration Tools**: Pre-built integrations with platforms like [Make](https://www.make.com/en/integrations/vapi) and GoHighLevel (GHL) that let you trigger automated workflows via voice.

<Info>
  Tools are configured as part of your assistant's model configuration. You can find the complete API reference [here](/api-reference/tools/create-tool).

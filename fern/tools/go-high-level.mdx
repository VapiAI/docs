The GoHighLevel integration empowers your Vapi voice agents to directly interact with your clients\' GoHighLevel calendars. Your agents can use a suite of tools to manage the appointment lifecycle: check if a contact already exists using the **Get Contact** tool, create new leads or clients with the **Create Contact** tool, query specific GHL calendars for open slots via the **Check Availability** tool, and secure appointments associated with a contact using the **Create Event** tool. This enables your voice agent to handle the entire booking process seamlessly within the GHL calendar that your agency or client already uses.

## Prerequisites

Before you can use the GoHighLevel integration, you need to:

1. Have a GoHighLevel account.
2. Have a calendar in GoHighLevel to which you have permission to create and edit events.
3. Have access to the Vapi Dashboard.

## Setup Steps

### 1. Connect GoHighLevel Account

First, you need to connect your GoHighLevel account to Vapi:

1. Navigate to the Vapi Dashboard.
2. Go to **Providers Keys** > **Tools Provider** > **GoHighLevel**.
3. Click the **Connect** button.
4. A GoHighLevel authorization popup will appear.
5. Follow the prompts to authorize Vapi to access your GoHighLevel account.

<Note>
  The authorization process will request access to your GoHighLevel account to
  manage contacts, calendars, and appointments.

### 2. Create GoHighLevel Tools

After connecting your GoHighLevel account, create the tools:

1. Go to **Dashboard** > **Tools** page.
2. Click the **Create Tool** button.
3. Select **GoHighLevel** from the available options.
4. Choose which tool(s) you want to create (e.g., Get Contact, Create Contact, Check Availability, Create Event).
5. For each tool, provide a clear and descriptive name. Adding a description is optional. If you leave it blank, Vapi will automatically generate a default description that explains the tool's purpose and includes the current date, formatted using the timezone you specify in the tool's metadata.
6. For the **Check Availability** and **Create Event** tools, ensure you provide a valid `calendarId`. You can find the `calendarId` for each of your calendars in GoHighLevel by navigating to **Settings** > **Calendars**. Each calendar listed will display its unique ID.

<Note>
  When creating an event in GoHighLevel, a `contactId` is required. Therefore,
  if you plan to use the **Create Event** tool, you **must** also add the **Get
  Contact** and **Create Contact** tools. This allows the assistant to first
  retrieve an existing contact\'s ID or create a new contact, and then use that
  ID to schedule the event.

### 3. Add Tools to Assistant

Now, add your chosen GoHighLevel tool(s) to your assistant. For an example scenario where you want your assistant to book appointments, including finding a suitable time and managing contact information, you would add all four tools: Get Contact, Create Contact, Check Availability, and Create Event.

1. Navigate to **Dashboard** > **Assistants** page.
2. Select your assistant.
3. Go to the **Tools** tab.
4. In the tools dropdown, select the GoHighLevel tool(s) you want to use.
5. Click **Publish** to save your changes.

### 4. Configure Assistant System Prompt

After adding the GoHighLevel tools to your assistant, it\'s crucial to provide a clear system prompt. This prompt guides the assistant on how and when to use each tool to achieve the desired workflow. For a typical appointment booking scenario, your system prompt instructs the AI on the sequence of operations and conditions for using each tool.

Here\'s an example system prompt to guide your assistant. Remember to replace `ghl_contact_get`, `ghl_contact_create`, `ghl_check_availability`, and `ghl_create_event` with the exact names you gave your tools if they are different.

```text
You are a helpful and efficient scheduling assistant. Your primary goal is to book appointments for users. Follow these steps carefully:

1.  **Gather Information**: Start by asking for the caller\'s full name and email address.
2.  **Check Existing Contact**: Use the `ghl_contact_get` tool to see if a contact already exists with the provided email.
3.  **Create Contact (if needed)**: If no contact is found, use the `ghl_contact_create` tool to create a new contact with their name and email.
4.  **Discuss Appointment Time**: Once you have a contact ID (either from an existing contact or a newly created one), ask the user for their preferred date and time for the appointment.
5.  **Check Availability**: Use the `ghl_check_availability` tool to check for open slots. It\'s a good idea to check for the entire preferred day to offer alternatives if their initial request isn\'t available.
6.  **Confirm Time**: Discuss the available options with the user and agree on a suitable time.
7.  **Book Appointment**: Finally, use the `ghl_create_event` tool to book the appointment, ensuring you use the correct contact ID.

**Important Guidelines:**
*   Always use `ghl_contact_get` to check for an existing contact *before* attempting to create one with `ghl_contact_create`.
*   You *must* have a contact ID (from `ghl_contact_get` or `ghl_contact_create`) *before* you can book an appointment with `ghl_create_event`.
*   Always confirm availability with `ghl_check_availability` *before* attempting to book an appointment with `ghl_create_event`.

- `calendarId`: The ID of the GoHighLevel calendar to check.
- `startDate`: The start of the time range to check for availability (epoch time in milliseconds).
- `endDate`: The end of the time range to check for availability (epoch time in milliseconds).

  "model": {
    "provider": "openai",
    "model": "gpt-4o",
    "messages": [

          },
          "metadata": {
              "calendarId": "CALENDAR_ID"
          }
      },
      {

              "description": "Use this tool to create a new contact in GoHighLevel."
          }
      }
  ]
  }
}
```

## Best Practices
1. **Clear Instructions**: Provide clear instructions in your assistant's system message about when to use each calendar tool
2. **Error Handling**: Include fallback responses for cases where either calendar tool fails
3. **Time Zone Awareness**: Always specify the correct timezone for events and availability checks. Also remember to format {{now}} with your desired timezone.
4. **Event Details**: Ensure all required fields are properly filled when creating events
5. **Availability Flow**: Check availability before attempting to schedule events to avoid conflicts
6. **Contact Prerequisite for Events**: Remember that creating an event in GoHighLevel requires a `contactId`. Ensure your assistant\'s logic always fetches or creates a contact (using the `getGHLContact` and `createGHLContact` tools) before attempting to book an appointment with the `createGHLEvent` tool.

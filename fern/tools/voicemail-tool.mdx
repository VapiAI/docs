<Warning>
**Beta Feature**: The voicemail tool is currently in beta. Features and behavior may change as we continue to improve this functionality based on user feedback.
</Warning>

## Overview

The voicemail tool gives your assistant direct control over when and how to leave voicemail messages. Unlike [automatic voicemail detection](/calls/voicemail-detection), which operates independently of your assistant, this tool allows your assistant to decide when it's reached a voicemail system and leave a configured message.

**Key benefits:**
- **Maximum flexibility** - Assistant decides when and what to say
- **Cost-effective** - Only triggers when needed
- **Context-aware** - Messages can be customized based on conversation
- **Simple integration** - Works like other built-in tools

## How it works

When you add the voicemail tool to your assistant:

1. Your assistant listens for voicemail indicators (greetings mentioning "unavailable", "leave a message", etc.)
2. Upon detecting voicemail, the assistant calls the tool
3. The tool delivers your configured message
4. The call ends automatically after message delivery

<Note>
This approach differs from [automatic voicemail detection](/calls/voicemail-detection), which detects voicemail at the system level. The voicemail tool puts detection and response entirely in the assistant's hands.
</Note>

## Configuration

Add the voicemail tool to your assistant's tools array:

<CodeBlocks>
```json title="API Configuration"
{
  "model": {
    "provider": "openai",
    "model": "gpt-4o",
    "messages": [
      {
        "type": "system",
        "content": "You are a sales representative for Acme Corp. If at any point you determine you're speaking to a voicemail system (greeting mentions 'unavailable', 'leave a message', 'voicemail', etc.), immediately use the leave_voicemail tool."
      }
    ],
    "tools": [
      {
        "type": "voicemail",
        "function": {
          "name": "leave_voicemail",
          "description": "Leave a voicemail message when you detect you've reached a voicemail system"
        },
        "messages": [
          {
            "type": "request-start",
            "content": "Hi, this is {{company}}. {{message}}. Please call us back at {{phone}}."
          }
        ]
      }
    ]
  }
}
```
```typescript title="TypeScript SDK"
import { VapiClient } from "@vapi-ai/server-sdk";

const vapi = new VapiClient({ token: process.env.VAPI_API_KEY });

const assistant = await vapi.assistants.create({
  model: {
    provider: "openai",
    model: "gpt-4o",
    messages: [{
      type: "system",
      content: `You are a sales representative for Acme Corp. 
                If at any point you determine you're speaking to a voicemail system 
                (greeting mentions 'unavailable', 'leave a message', 'voicemail', etc.), 
                immediately use the leave_voicemail tool.`
    }],
    tools: [{
      type: "voicemail",
      function: {
        name: "leave_voicemail",
        description: "Leave a voicemail message when you detect you've reached a voicemail system"
      },
      messages: [{
        type: "request-start",
        content: "Hi, this is {{company}}. {{message}}. Please call us back at {{phone}}."
      }]
    }]
  }
});
```
```python title="Python SDK"
from vapi import Vapi

client = Vapi(token=os.getenv("VAPI_API_KEY"))

assistant = client.assistants.create(
    model={
        "provider": "openai",
        "model": "gpt-4o",
        "messages": [{
            "type": "system",
            "content": """You are a sales representative for Acme Corp.

                         (greeting mentions 'unavailable', 'leave a message', 'voicemail', etc.), 
                         immediately use the leave_voicemail tool."""
        }],
        "tools": [{
            "type": "voicemail",
            "function": {
                "name": "leave_voicemail",
                "description": "Leave a voicemail message when you detect you've reached a voicemail system"
            },
            "messages": [{
                "type": "request-start",
                "content": "Hi, this is {{company}}. {{message}}. Please call us back at {{phone}}."
            }]
        }]
    }
)
```
</CodeBlocks>

## Message Configuration

Define the voicemail message in the tool configuration:

### **Text-to-Speech Messages**

```json
{
  "messages": [
    {
      "type": "request-start",
      "content": "Hi, this is {{company}}. {{message}}. Please call us back at {{phone}}."
    }
  ]
}
```

<Tip>
Use template variables like `{{company}}`, `{{message}}`, and `{{phone}}` to make your voicemail messages dynamic while keeping them consistent.
</Tip>

### **Pre-recorded Audio Messages**

For consistent quality and pronunciation, use pre-recorded audio files by providing the URL in the `content` field:

```json
{
  "messages": [
    {
      "type": "request-start",
      "content": "https://example.com/voicemail.mp3"
    }
  ]
}
```

**Supported formats**: `.wav` and `.mp3` files

<Note>
Pre-recorded audio messages are ideal for brand-specific messaging or when you need precise pronunciation of phone numbers, website URLs, or company names.
</Note>

## Advanced Examples

### **Pre-recorded Audio Example**

Using pre-recorded audio for professional voicemail messages:

```json
{
  "model": {
    "provider": "openai",
    "model": "gpt-4o",
    "messages": [
      {
        "type": "system",
        "content": "You are a sales representative calling prospects. If you reach voicemail, use the leave_voicemail tool to play our professional pre-recorded message."
      }
    ],
    "tools": [
      {
        "type": "voicemail",
        "function": {
          "name": "leave_voicemail",
          "description": "Leave a professional pre-recorded voicemail message"
        },
        "messages": [
          {
            "type": "request-start",
            "content": "https://example.com/professional-sales-voicemail.mp3"
          }
        ]
      }
    ]
  }
}
```

### **Dynamic voicemail with context**

```json
{
  "model": {
    "provider": "openai",
    "model": "gpt-4o",
    "messages": [
      {
        "type": "system",
        "content": "You are calling leads about their recent inquiry. If you reach voicemail, use the leave_voicemail tool and mention their specific interest."
      }
    ],
    "tools": [
      {
        "type": "voicemail",
        "function": {
          "name": "leave_voicemail",
          "description": "Leave a personalized voicemail message"
        },
        "messages": [
          {
            "type": "request-start",
            "content": "Hi {{customer_name}}, this is {{agent_name}} from {{company}} following up on your inquiry about {{product_interest}}. I'd love to discuss how we can help. Please call me back at {{callback_number}} or I'll try you again tomorrow. Thanks!"
          }
        ]
      }
    ]
  }
}
```



## Best Practices

### Detection prompting
Be specific about voicemail indicators in your system prompt:
- "unavailable"
- "leave a message"
- "voicemail"
- "at the tone"
- "beep"

### Message structure
Keep voicemail messages:
- **Brief** - Under 30 seconds
- **Clear** - State name, company, and purpose
- **Actionable** - Include callback number or next steps
- **Professional** - Match your brand voice

### Error handling
Consider edge cases:
- Long voicemail greetings
- Voicemail box full scenarios
- Systems requiring keypad input

## Voicemail Tool vs. Automatic Detection

| Feature | Voicemail Tool | [Automatic Detection](/calls/voicemail-detection) |
|---------|----------------|---------------------------------------------------|
| Control | Assistant-driven | System-driven |
| Flexibility | High - custom logic | Medium - predefined behavior |
| Cost | Lower - only when used | Higher - continuous monitoring |
| Setup complexity | Simple - just add tool | Moderate - configure detection |
| Message customization | Full control | Limited to configured message |
| Detection accuracy | Depends on prompt | Provider-specific (Vapi, Google, etc.) |

<Info>
Choose the **voicemail tool** when you need maximum flexibility and cost efficiency. Choose **automatic detection** when you need guaranteed system-level detection without relying on assistant prompting.

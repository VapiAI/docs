<Warning>
  **Action Required:** The following legacy voices will be retired on **March 1, 2026**: Spencer, Neha, Harry, Cole, Paige, Hana, Lily, Kylie, and Rohan. Migrate your assistants before this date to maintain uninterrupted service.
</Warning>

## Overview

We're updating Vapi Voices to provide you with the best possible voice experience. As part of this update, we're phasing out nine legacy voices and replacing them with carefully selected alternatives that maintain similar tone and style characteristics.

## Legacy voices being retired

The following voices will be retired on **March 1, 2026**:

- Spencer
- Neha
- Harry
- Cole
- Paige
- Hana
- Lily
- Kylie
- Rohan

## What this means for you

- **Existing assistants** using these voices will continue to work during the transition period
- **New assistants** can no longer be created using legacy voices
- **After March 1, 2026**, any assistants still using legacy voices will be automatically switched to the default replacement voice (Option 1 in the table below)

## Replacement voice mapping

We've selected replacement voices from the same providers (ElevenLabs/Cartesia) at the same pricing. These were chosen using ElevenLabs' voice matching tool to find the closest match in tone and style.

<Note>
  The replacement voice data will be populated soon. Check back for updates or contact support for assistance with voice selection.

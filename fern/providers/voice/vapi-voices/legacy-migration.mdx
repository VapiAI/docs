## Voice availability update

We're updating Vapi Voices. Some legacy voices are being phased out while others will continue to be available.

### Voices being retired on March 1, 2026

The following voices will be retired and are no longer available for new assistants:

- Spencer
- Neha
- Harry
- Cole
- Paige
- Hana
- Lily
- Kylie

### Voices that are staying

The following Vapi Voices will continue to be fully supported and are **not** being retired:

- Elliot
- Savannah
- Leo
- Zoe
- Mia
- Jess
- Zac
- Dan
- Leah
- Tara
- Rohan

<Note>
If you're currently using one of the voices that are staying, no action is required on your part.
</Note>

## What this means

- **Existing assistants** using these voices will continue to work during the transition period
- **New assistants** can no longer be created using legacy voices
- **After March 1, 2026**, any assistants still using legacy voices will be automatically switched to the default replacement voice (Option 1 in the table below)

## Replacement voice mapping

We've selected replacement voices from ElevenLabs using their voice matching tool to find the closest match in tone and style. These voices are priced similarly to your existing voice.

<Note>
**Option 1 is the default fallback** — if you don't switch by March 1, your assistant will automatically be switched to the Option 1 voice.

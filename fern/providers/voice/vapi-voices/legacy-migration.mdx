---

<Warning>
  **Action Required by March 1, 2026:** The legacy voices listed below are being retired. You must migrate your assistants to replacement voices before this deadline.
</Warning>

## Legacy voices being retired

The following Vapi Voices are being phased out:

- Spencer
- Neha
- Harry
- Cole
- Paige
- Hana
- Lily
- Kylie
- Rohan

## What this means

- **Existing assistants** using these voices will continue to work during the transition period
- **New assistants** can no longer be created using legacy voices
- **After March 1, 2026**, any assistants still using legacy voices will be automatically switched to the default replacement voice (Option 1 in the table below)

## Replacement voice mapping

We have identified three replacement options for each legacy voice. Option 1 is the default fallback that will be automatically applied after March 1, 2026.

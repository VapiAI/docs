Your assistants can be configured to record chat conversations and upload
the recordings to a bucket in GCP Cloud Storage when the conversation ends.  You will
need to configure the credential and bucket settings in the "Cloud Providers"
section of the "Provider Credentials" page in the Vapi dashboard.

See these [instructions](https://cloud.google.com/iam/docs/keys-create-delete) for generating service account keys for GCP.

See these [instructions](https://cloud.google.com/storage/docs/authentication/hmackeys) for generating HMAC Keys for Cloud Storage.

Your assistants can be configured to record chat conversations and upload
the recordings to a bucket in Cloudflare R2 when the conversation ends.  You will
need to configure the credential and bucket settings in the "Cloud Providers"
section of the "Provider Credentials" page in the Vapi dashboard.

See these [instructions](https://developers.cloudflare.com/r2/api/s3/tokens/) for generating R2 tokens and access keys.

Bucket URL               | This is required only for buckets with a custom hostname or domain name. Enter the hostname for the bucket.

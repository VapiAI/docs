Your assistants can be configured to record chat conversations and upload
the recordings to a bucket in Supabase Storage when the conversation ends.  You will
need to configure the credential and bucket settings in the "Cloud Providers"
section of the "Provider Credentials" page in the Vapi dashboard.

See these [instructions](https://supabase.com/docs/guides/storage/s3/authentication) for generating Supabase tokens and access keys, and finding your endpoint and region.

## What is Gladia?  
Gladia is a state-of-the-art audio transcription and intelligence platform. It provides **real-time** speech-to-text for audio and video and adds advanced audio-intelligence features so you can turn unstructured audio into actionable insights. It integrates easily and scales so you can focus on building features instead of transcription infrastructure.

## Why choose Gladia on Vapi for speech-to-text?  

### Low latency transcription

### Global language coverage  
Gladia supports **110+ languages** and dialects and robustly handles multilingual and mixed-language audio. It also supports mixed-language and code-switch scenarios for natural conversations and multilingual conversations.

### Audio intelligence add-ons  
Translation is available in one API call to one or more target languages. Gladia also offers summarization post-call, sentiment analysis, and named-entity recognition in real-time, enabling meeting notes, customer-call insights, and content production workflows on top of transcripts.

### API and integrations  
Gladia offers telephony compatibility (SIP/VoIP) and noise resistance for live use cases, and supports real-time streaming with low-latency interfaces for platforms and contact centers. It also provides a developer-friendly playground to test and monitor your transcription workflows.

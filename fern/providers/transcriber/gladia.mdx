## What is Gladia?  
Gladia is a state-of-the-art audio transcription and intelligence platform. It provides **real-time** speech-to-text processing for audio and video, and layers on advanced audio-intelligence tools that let businesses convert unstructured audio into actionable insights.
Their product is built to integrate easily and scale, enabling companies to focus on building features rather than transcription infrastructure.

## The Evolution of AI Transcription  
Transcription technology has progressed from simple speech recognition systems to full-blown platforms that handle real-time streaming, multilingual audio, code-switching, speaker-diarization, and deep analytics. Gladia's technology reflects this shift: their engine is designed for live audio, multi-channel, noisy environments, and supports extensive language coverage.
As voice continues to become a primary interface for human-machine interaction, transcription and audio intelligence are becoming foundational rather than optional.

## Overview of Gladia's Offerings  

### Speech-to-Text  
Their core offering is accurate, fast speech-to-text:  
- Real-time transcription: low latency (under ~300 ms in many cases) for live audio and calls.
- Multilingual and code-switch capable: supporting **100+ languages** and mixed-language audio.
- Speaker diarization, word-level timestamps, custom vocabulary, etc., enabling powerful downstream workflows.

### Audio Intelligence  
Beyond transcription, they provide add-ons that transform audio into richer outputs:  
- Translation: translate transcripts into one or more target languages in one API call.
- Summarization, chapter-detection, sentiment analysis, named-entity recognition and more.
These intelligence features enable building applications around meetings, customer calls, content production, and more.

### API & Integrations  
Their API is designed for developers: REST/JSON endpoints, webhooks, callbacks, SDKs, and compatibility with telephony protocols (SIP/VoIP) for live use-cases.
They support real-time streaming via suitably low-latency APIsâ€”so platforms, contact centres, and media producers can all use the same backbone for live scenarios.

## Gladia's Technology  

### Features  
- **Real-time latency**: their transcription engine supports live streaming with under 300 ms latency in many cases.
- **Multilingual support**: more than 100 languages and dialects, with code-switching support.
- **World-class timestamps**: provide word-level timing for precise analytics/subtitles.
- **Custom vocabulary & domain adaptation**: tailor the model to your terminology for better accuracy.
- **Audio intelligence add-ons**: summarization, entity recognition, sentiment, real-time translation.

### Benefits  
- **Efficiency**: Transcription and analysis workflows become far faster and more automated, reducing manual burden.  
- **Scalability**: Built to handle large volumes of audio/video in live scenarios, globally.
- **Global readiness**: With broad multilingual support and live streaming capability, they can deploy in many regions/languages.
- **Integrability**: Developer-friendly APIs mean they can embed transcription plus intelligence into their apps or platforms cleanly.

## Real-time Transcription and Translation  
Gladia is particularly strong at live use-cases: they handle real-time streaming audio (e.g., from calls, meetings, live events) with sub-300 ms latency, and can simultaneously transcribe and translate in 100+ languages.
Use-cases include: live meeting captions, contact centre agent assistance, voice bots, or multilingual live events.

## Use Cases for Gladia  
Here are some strong scenarios where Gladia shines:  
- **Voice agents**: Real-time transcription, speaker attribution, translation and post-meeting summaries.
- **Virtual Meetings**: Real-time transcription, speaker attribution, translation and post-meeting summaries.  
- **Customer Service / Contact Centres**: Live transcription of calls, sentiment/keyword extraction, multilingual agent assistance.  
- **Sales Enablement**: Capture names/emails/details across languages and accents, feed CRMs, enable global sales teams.  
- **Media & Content Creation**: Transcribe/edit video/audio, generate subtitles (SRT/VTT), translate for global distribution.  

## Impact on Business Operations  
By embedding Gladia's transcription + audio intelligence, enterprises can shift from manual audio workflows (listening, typing, editing) to automated pipelines. This frees up teams to focus on strategy, insights and growth rather than operational overhead.  
With real-time capabilities and broad language support, they also expand their reach globally and reduce latency in delivering actionable outputs from voice data.

## Innovation and Research  
Gladia stays at the forefront of audio AI research. Their engineering team continually advances their ASR/NLP engine (e.g., optimized versions of AI speech-to-text models, speaker-diarization, real-time adaptation) and explores new features such as code-switching, noise robustness, and live streaming architecture.
We believe voice is the ultimate interface: speaking should be the most natural way to build, access and connect with technology.

## AI Safety and Ethics  
Responsible AI use is built-in. Gladia offers enterprise-grade data governance, secure hosting options, and alignment with privacy/compliance best practices (such as GDPR). They focus on avoiding hallucinations in transcripts and ensuring veracity in business-critical settings. EU and US regions are available for data residency.

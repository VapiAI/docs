## Overview

Sympana Connector adds a plug-and-play automation layer between your Vapi agents and GoHighLevel (GHL). It replaces brittle middleware such as Make, Zapier, or custom servers with a managed experience that handles outbound sequences, inbound routing, data syncing, and CRM-specific logic directly inside GHL. Teams deploy workflows that usually take six to eight hours of engineering work in a single click, while keeping every interaction inside the familiar GHL UI.

<Note>
  Sympana is fully HIPAA and GDPR compliant, so you can run regulated healthcare,
  finance, insurance, or any other data-sensitive workloads without adding a
  separate compliance review.
</Note>

## Key benefits

- **Instant outbound calling**: Trigger Vapi-powered outbound calls from any GHL workflow, pipeline stage, or CRM event.
- **Full inbound agent support**: Run receptionist-style agents with routing, dispatching, voicemail capture, and post-call summaries.
- **Native GoHighLevel automation**: Manage calendars, appointments, tags, notes, opportunities, and contact syncing without manual API mapping.
- **Advanced timezone intelligence**: Automatically reach leads during the best-performing windows based on their local timezone.
- **No servers or backend work**: Everything ships prebuilt for Vapi + GHL, so you skip hosting, HTTP nodes, and custom scripts.
- **HIPAA + GDPR ready**: Use one connector for both compliance regimes.
- **Deploy complete systems in minutes**: Launch outbound, inbound, and appointment flows using the 50+ starter automations Sympana supplies.
- **Enterprise stability**: Built for agencies that need scale, retry logic, and observability for high-volume calling.

## How it works

<Steps>
  <Step title="Install Sympana Connector">
    Add Sympana Connector to your GoHighLevel agency and select the sub-accounts
    where Vapi agents should operate.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Connect your Vapi agent">
    Complete the Sympana setup form to link each Vapi agent. Sympana manages all
    API calls, so you never build HTTP nodes or scripts.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Choose automation flows">
    Start with Sympana's prebuilt outbound, inbound, and appointment flows, or
    drop Sympana actions inside your existing GHL workflows.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Go live inside GoHighLevel">
    Publish the workflows and let your agents place calls, answer inbound calls,
    book or reschedule appointments, and sync CRM updates directly within GHL.
  </Step>
</Steps>

## Why Sympana instead of the native GoHighLevel connector?

Vapi ships a lightweight GoHighLevel integration for simple actions (create contact, basic calendar bookings). Sympana extends that by covering the entire automation lifecycle:

- **Workflow-level control**: Vapi's native tools handle single actions, while Sympana orchestrates full outbound sequences and multi-step flows with retries.
- **Pipeline + CRM syncing**: Sympana manages pipelines, tags, opportunities, and notes, ensuring every call outcome lands in the right place automatically.
- **Bidirectional call handling**: Run outbound campaigns and inbound routing/dispatch from the same connector.
- **Timezone + sequencing logic**: Built-in intelligence determines the best call windows and handles follow-up attempts without extra logic blocks.
- **Operational stability**: Sympana includes monitoring, rate controls, and scaling patterns purpose-built for high-volume agencies.

## Replacing traditional automation stacks

Sympana removes the layers normally required when gluing Vapi to GHL through generic automation tools:

- No server setup or maintenance
- No HTTP calls or REST node mapping
- No API schema management
- No multi-step workflow chaining
- No external tools required
- Real-time syncing between Vapi events and GHL objects

Most agencies report that 95% of Sympana actions are completely free. Only **Place Call Trigger**, **Get Call**, and **Wait (For Lead's Time)** consume paid usage, so you can automate qualification flows, bookings, outbound sequences, inbound dashboards, tagging, notes, and CRM syncing at no extra cost.

## Get started

1. **Install Sympana Connector** inside your GoHighLevel agency and authorize the sub-accounts that need Vapi-powered automations.
2. **Link your Vapi agents** through Sympana's setup form to sync tools, phone numbers, and calendars instantly.

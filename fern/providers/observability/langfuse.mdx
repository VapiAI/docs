## What is Langfuse?

[Langfuse](https://langfuse.com/) is an open source LLM engineering platform designed to provide better **[observability](/docs/tracing)** and **[evaluations](/docs/scores/overview)** into AI applications. It helps developers track, analyze, and visualize traces from AI interactions, enabling better performance tuning, debugging, and optimization of AI agents.

## Get Started

<Steps>
<Step title="Get your Langfuse Credentials">

First, you'll need your Langfuse credentials:

- **Secret Key**
- **Public Key**
- **Host URL**

You can obtain these by signing up for [Langfuse Cloud](https://cloud.langfuse.com/) or [self-hosting Langfuse](https://langfuse.com/docs/deployment/self-host).

</Step>

<Step title="Add Langfuse Credentials">

Log in to your Vapi dashboard and navigate to the [Provider Credentials page](https://dashboard.vapi.ai/keys).

Under the **Observability Providers** section, you'll find an option for **Langfuse**. Enter your Langfuse credentials:

- **Secret Key**
- **Public Key**
- **Host URL** (US data region: `https://us.cloud.langfuse.com`, EU data region: `https://cloud.langfuse.com`)

Click **Save** to update your credentials.

</Step>

<Step title="Evaluate and Debug your Agent">

To make the most out of this integration, you can now use Langfuse's [evaluation](https://langfuse.com/docs/scores/overview) and [debugging](https://langfuse.com/docs/analytics/overview) tools to analyze and improve the performance of your voice AI agents.

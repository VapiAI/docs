      </Step>
      <Step title="Assign phone number">
        - Go to the Numbers tab
        - Assign your acquired phone number to the SIP trunk
      </Step>

        <Info>
          You can get your Vapi SIP URI when you create a new SIP number through the **Phone Numbers** tab in the Vapi dashboard. The URI will look like:
          <br />
          <code>sip:&lt;your-unique-id&gt;@sip.vapi.ai</code>
        </Info>
        *This setting modifies the SIP Invite so invites are correctly routed to your Vapi SIP URI.*

      </Step>
    </Steps>
  </Step>

  <Step title="Add your Telnyx SIP credentials to Vapi">
    Use the Vapi API to create a SIP trunk credential:
    <Warning>
      Use IP addresses in `gateways`. FQDNs like `sip.telnyx.com` return a `400 Bad Request`.
    </Warning>
    ```bash
    curl -X POST https://api.vapi.ai/credential \
      -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
      -H "Authorization: Bearer YOUR_VAPI_PRIVATE_KEY" \
      -d '{
        "provider": "byo-sip-trunk",
        "name": "Telnyx Trunk",
        "gateways": [
          {
            "ip": "192.76.120.10",
            "inboundEnabled": true
          },
          {
            "ip": "64.16.250.10",
            "inboundEnabled": true
          }
        ],
        "outboundAuthenticationPlan": {
          "authUsername": "YOUR_SIP_USERNAME",
          "authPassword": "YOUR_SIP_PASSWORD",
          "sipRegisterPlan": {
            "realm": "sip.telnyx.com"
          }
        }
      }'
    ```
    Replace `YOUR_VAPI_PRIVATE_KEY`, `YOUR_SIP_USERNAME`, and `YOUR_SIP_PASSWORD` with your actual credentials.
    Replace the gateway IPs with the Telnyx gateway IPs assigned to your trunk.
    Set `inboundEnabled` to `false` if you only need outbound calls.
    If successful, the response will include an `id` for the created credential, which you'll use in the next step.
  </Step>

  <Step title="Add your phone number to Vapi">
    Associate your phone number with the SIP trunk in Vapi:
    ```bash
    curl -X POST https://api.vapi.ai/phone-number \
      -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
      -H "Authorization: Bearer YOUR_VAPI_PRIVATE_KEY" \
      -d '{
        "provider": "byo-phone-number",
        "name": "Telnyx SIP Number",
        "number": "YOUR_PHONE_NUMBER",
        "numberE164CheckEnabled": false,
        "credentialId": "YOUR_CREDENTIAL_ID"
      }'
    ```
    Replace `YOUR_VAPI_PRIVATE_KEY`, `YOUR_PHONE_NUMBER`, and `YOUR_CREDENTIAL_ID` with your actual details.
  </Step>

  <Step title="Assign your voice assistant to handle calls">
    - In your Vapi dashboard, go to the **Build** section and select **Phone Numbers**
    - Click on your **Telnyx Number**
    - In the **Inbound Settings** section, assign your voice assistant to handle incoming calls
    - In the **Outbound Form** section, assign your voice assistant to handle outgoing calls
  </Step>

  <Step title="Make outbound calls">
    To initiate outbound calls through your Telnyx SIP trunk:
    ```bash
    curl --location 'https://api.vapi.ai/call/phone' \
      --header 'Authorization: Bearer YOUR_VAPI_PRIVATE_KEY' \
      --header 'Content-Type: application/json' \
      --data '{
        "assistantId": "YOUR_ASSISTANT_ID",
        "customer": {
          "number": "CUSTOMER_PHONE_NUMBER",
          "numberE164CheckEnabled": false
        },
        "phoneNumberId": "YOUR_PHONE_ID"
      }'
    ```
    Replace all placeholder values with your actual information.
  </Step>
</Steps>

By following these steps, your Telnyx SIP trunk will be fully integrated with Vapi, allowing your AI voice assistants to manage calls effectively.

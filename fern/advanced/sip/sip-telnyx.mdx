## Inbound
### On Vapi
<Steps>
<Step title="Personalized origination SIP URI creation">

First we will create a personalized origination SIP URI via the Vapi API 

```json
curl --location 'https://api.vapi.ai/phone-number' \
	--header 'Authorization: Bearer your-vapi-private-api-key' \
	--header 'Content-Type: application/json' \
	--data-raw '{
		"provider": "vapi",
		"sipUri": "sip:username@sip.vapi.ai",
		"assistantId": "your-assistant-id"
	}'
```
 - ```provider```: This is set to "vapi".
 - ```sipUri```: Replace ` username ` with your desired SIP username.
 - ```assistantId```: Provide your specific `assistant ID` associated with your Vapi AI account.
</Step>

<Step title="[Optional] Send call request to a webhook instead of assistant">

Send a PATCH to /phone-number/your_phone_id

```json
 curl --location --request PATCH 'https://api.vapi.ai/phone-number/your_phone_id' \
 	--header 'Content-Type: application/json' \
 	--header 'Authorization: Bearer your-vapi-private-api-key' \
 	--data '{
 		"assistantId": null,
 		"serverUrl": "https://your_server_url"
 	}'
```
- `your_server_url` is the webhook link that will receive the assistant request.
- `your_phone_id` is the id of your just created origination sip URI

Now every time you make a call to this number (i.e. assigned numbers on SIP trunking to this origination URI), you'll get a webhook event requesting an assistant.
</Step>

### On Vapi
<Steps>
<Step title="Create a SIP Trunk Credential through Vapi API">
```json 
curl -X POST https://api.vapi.ai/credential \
	-H "Content-Type: application/json" \
	-H "Authorization: Bearer your-vapi-private-api-key" \
	-d '{
		"provider": "byo-sip-trunk",
		"name": "Telnyx Trunk",
		"gateways": [
			{
				"ip": "sip.telnyx.com"
			}
		]
	}'
```
</Step>
<Step title="Create a Phone Number Associated with the SIP Trunk">
```json
curl -X POST https://api.vapi.ai/phone-number \
	-H "Content-Type: application/json" \
	-H "Authorization: Bearer your-vapi-private-api-key" \
		-d '{
			"provider": "byo-phone-number",
			"name": "Telnyx SIP Number",
			"number": "your-sip-phone-number",
			"numberE164CheckEnabled": false,
			"credentialId": "your-new-trunk-credential-id-which-you-got-from-previous-step"
		}'
```
</Step>
<Step title="Start making outbound calls">
Use this cURL to trigger calls with tech prefix
```json
curl --location 'https://api.vapi.ai/call/phone' \
	--header 'Authorization: Bearer your-vapi-private-api-key' \
	--header 'Content-Type: application/json' \
	--data '{
		"assistantId": "your-assistant-id",
		"customer": {	
			"number": "tech-prefix-with-phone-number-without-plus-signal",
			"numberE164CheckEnabled": false
		},
	"phoneNumberId": "your-phone-id"
}'
```
Example of tech-prefix-with-phone-number-without-plus-signal
- Phone number: +6699999999
- Tech Prefix: 1234
- Should look like this: 12346699999999
- No + as you can see

Done! Outbound should now be working!

Integrate your Zadarma SIP trunk with Vapi.ai to enable your AI voice assistants to handle calls efficiently. Follow the steps below to set up this integration:

## 1. Retrieve Your Vapi.ai Private Key

- Log in to your Vapi.ai account.
- Navigate to **Organization Settings**.
- In the **API Keys** section, copy your **Private Key**.

## 2. Add Your Zadarma SIP Credentials to Vapi.ai

You'll need to send a `curl` request to Vapi.ai's API to add your SIP credentials:

- **Private Key**: Your Vapi.ai private key.
- **Trunk Name**: A name for your SIP trunk (e.g., "Zadarma Trunk").
- **Server Address**: The server address provided by Zadarma (e.g., "sip.zadarma.com").
- **SIP Number**: Your Zadarma SIP number.
- **SIP Password**: The password for your Zadarma SIP number.

Here's the `curl` command to execute:

```bash
curl -L 'https://api.vapi.ai/credential' \\
-H 'Content-Type: application/json' \\
-H 'Authorization: Bearer YOUR_PRIVATE_KEY' \\
-d '{
  "provider": "byo-sip-trunk",
  "name": "Zadarma Trunk",
  "gateways": [
    { "ip": "sip.zadarma.com" }
  ],
  "outboundLeadingPlusEnabled": true,
  "outboundAuthenticationPlan": {
    "authUsername": "YOUR_SIP_NUMBER",
    "authPassword": "YOUR_SIP_PASSWORD"
  }
}'
```
Replace `YOUR_PRIVATE_KEY`, `YOUR_SIP_NUMBER`, and `YOUR_SIP_PASSWORD` with your actual credentials.

If successful, the response will include an `id` for the created credential, which you'll use in the next step.

## 3. Add Your Virtual Number to Vapi.ai

Next, associate your virtual number with the SIP trunk in Vapi.ai:

- **Private Key**: Your Vapi.ai private key.
- **Number Name**: A name for your virtual number (e.g., "Zadarma Number").
- **Virtual Number**: Your Zadarma virtual number in international format (e.g., "15551111111").
- **Credential ID**: The `id` from the previous step.

Use the following `curl` command:

```bash
curl -L 'https://api.vapi.ai/phone-number' \\
-H 'Content-Type: application/json' \\
-H 'Authorization: Bearer YOUR_PRIVATE_KEY' \\
-d '{
  "provider": "byo-phone-number",
  "name": "Zadarma Number",
  "number": "YOUR_VIRTUAL_NUMBER",
  "numberE164CheckEnabled": false,
  "credentialId": "YOUR_CREDENTIAL_ID"
}'
```

Replace `YOUR_PRIVATE_KEY`, `YOUR_VIRTUAL_NUMBER`, and `YOUR_CREDENTIAL_ID` with your actual details.

## 4. Assign Your Voice Assistant to Handle Calls

- In your Vapi.ai dashboard, go to the **Build** section and select **Phone Numbers**.
- Click on your **Zadarma Number**.
- In the **Inbound Settings** section, assign your voice assistant to handle incoming calls.
- In the **Outbound Form** section, assign your voice assistant to handle outgoing calls.

## 5. Configure Incoming Call Reception in Zadarma

To forward incoming calls from your Zadarma virtual number to Vapi.ai:

- Log in to your Zadarma account.
- Navigate to **Settings** → **Virtual phone numbers**.
- Click the ⚙ (gear) icon next to your number.
- Open the **External server** tab.
- Enable **External server (SIP URI)**.
- Enter the address: `YOUR_VIRTUAL_NUMBER@sip.vapi.ai` (replace `YOUR_VIRTUAL_NUMBER` with your number in international format).
- Click **Save**.

By following these steps, your Zadarma SIP trunk will be integrated with Vapi.ai, allowing your AI voice assistants to manage calls effectively.

SIP trunking replaces traditional phone lines with a virtual connection over the internet, allowing your business to make and receive calls via a broadband connection. It connects your internal PBX or VoIP system to a SIP provider, which then routes calls to the Public Switched Telephone Network (PSTN). This setup simplifies your communications infrastructure and often reduces costs.

## 1. Vapi SIP Trunking Options

Vapi supports multiple SIP trunk configurations, including:

- **Telnyx**: Uses SIP gateway domain (e.g., sip.telnyx.com) with IP-based authentication. May require a tech prefix for outbound calls.
- **Zadarma**: Uses SIP credentials (username/password) with its SIP server (e.g., sip.zadarma.com).
- **Custom "BYO" SIP Trunk**: Allows integration with any SIP provider. You simply provide the SIP gateway address and the necessary authentication details.

## 2. Setup Process Overview

To set up a SIP trunk in Vapi, follow these steps:

### Obtain Provider Details

Gather the SIP server address, authentication credentials (username/password or IP-based), and at least one phone number (DID) from your provider.

### Create a SIP Trunk Credential in Vapi

Use the Vapi API to create a new credential (type: byo-sip-trunk) with your provider's details. This informs Vapi how to connect to your SIP network.

**Example (using Zadarma):**

```bash
curl -X POST "https://api.vapi.ai/credential" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer YOUR_VAPI_PRIVATE_KEY" \
  -d '{
    "provider": "byo-sip-trunk",
    "name": "Zadarma Trunk",
    "gateways": [{
      "ip": "sip.zadarma.com"
    }],
    "outboundLeadingPlusEnabled": true,
    "outboundAuthenticationPlan": {
      "authUsername": "YOUR_SIP_NUMBER",
      "authPassword": "YOUR_SIP_PASSWORD"
    }
  }'
```

Save the returned Credential ID for later use.

### Associate a Phone Number with the SIP Trunk

Link your external phone number (DID) to the SIP trunk credential in Vapi by creating a Phone Number resource.

**Example:**

```bash
curl -X POST "https://api.vapi.ai/phone-number" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer YOUR_VAPI_PRIVATE_KEY" \
  -d '{
    "provider": "byo-phone-number",
    "name": "Zadarma Number",
    "number": "15551234567",
    "numberE164CheckEnabled": false,
    "credentialId": "YOUR_CREDENTIAL_ID"
  }'
```

Note the returned Phone Number ID for use in test calls.

### Test Your SIP Trunk

#### Outbound Call Test

Initiate a call through the Vapi dashboard or API to ensure outbound calls are properly routed.

**API Example:**

```json
POST https://api.vapi.ai/call/phone
{
  "assistantId": "YOUR_ASSISTANT_ID",
  "customer": {
    "number": "15557654321",
    "numberE164CheckEnabled": false
  },
  "phoneNumberId": "YOUR_PHONE_NUMBER_ID"
}
```

#### Inbound Call Test

If inbound routing is configured, call your phone number from an external line. Ensure your provider forwards calls to the correct SIP URI (e.g., `{phoneNumber}@sip.vapi.ai` for Zadarma).

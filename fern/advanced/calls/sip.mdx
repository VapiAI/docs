<Accordion title="1. Create an Assistant.">

## 1. Create an Assistant

We'll create an assistant with `POST /assistant` endpoint. This is no different than creating an assistant for other transports.

```json
{
	"name": "My SIP Assistant",
	"firstMessage": "Hello {{first_name}}, you've reached me over SIP. How can I help you today?"
}

```

</Accordion>

<Accordion title="2. Create a SIP Phone Number.">

## 2. Create A SIP Phone Number

We'll create a SIP phone number with `POST /phone-number` endpoint. 

```json
{
	"provider": "vapi",
	"sipUri": "sip:your_unique_user_name@sip.vapi.ai",
	"assistantId": "your_assistant_id"
}

```

`sipUri` is the SIP URI of the phone number. It must be in the format `sip:username@sip.vapi.ai`. You are free to choose any username you like.

</Accordion>



<Accordion title="3. Start a SIP call.">

## 3. Start a SIP call.

You can use any SIP softphone to test the Assistant. Examples include [Zoiper](https://www.zoiper.com/) or [Linphone](https://www.linphone.org/). 

You just need to dial `sip:your_unique_user_name@sip.vapi.ai` and the Assistant will answer your call. 

There is no authentication or SIP registration required.

</Accordion>

<Accordion title="4. Send SIP Headers to Fill Template Variables.">

## 4. Send SIP Headers to Fill Template Variables.

To fill your template variables, you can send custom SIP headers. 

For example, to fill the `first_name` variable, you can send a SIP header `x-first_name: John`. 

The header name is case insensitive. So, `X-First_Name`, `x-first_name`, and `X-FIRST_NAME` are all the same.

</Accordion>

<Accordion title="5. Use a Custom Assistant For Each Call.">

## 5. Use a Custom Assistant For Each Call.

You can use a custom assistant for SIP calls same as phone calls.

Set the `assistantId` to `null` and the `serverUrl` to the URL of your server which will respond to the `assistant-request`.

`PATCH /phone-number/:id`
```json
{
	"assistantId": null,
	"serverUrl": "https://your_server_url"
}
```

Now, every time you make a call to this phone number, the server will receive a `assistant-request` event.

Import the package:

```javascript
import Vapi from "@vapi-ai/web";
```

Then, create a new instance of the Vapi class, passing one of the following as a parameter to the constructor:
- your **Public Key**
- a generated **JWT**

```javascript
const vapi = new Vapi("your-public-key-or-jwt");
```

You can find your public key in the [Vapi Dashboard](https://dashboard.vapi.ai/account).
You can generate a JWT on the backend following [JWT Authentication](/customization/jwt-authentication) instructions.

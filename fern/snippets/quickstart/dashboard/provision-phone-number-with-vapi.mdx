The quickest way to secure a phone number for your assistant is to create a phone number directly through Vapi.

Navigate to the "Phone Numbers" section & click the "Create Phone Number" button:

We will use the area code `415` for our phone number (these are area codes domestic to the US & Canada).

<Info>
  Currently, only US & Canada phone numbers can be directly created through Vapi. Phone numbers in
  other regions must be imported, see our [phone calling](/phone-calling) guide.

Click "Create", after creating a phone number you should see something like this:

<Frame caption="Here we can attach an assistant to the number for inbound calls (or perform an outbound call, with a select assistant).">

</Frame>

<Note>
  It takes a couple of minutes for the phone number to be fully activated. During this period, calls will not be functional.
</Note>

The phone number is now ready to be used (either for inbound or outbound calling).

There are **2 ways** we can get a phone number into our Vapi account:

~1. **Create a Number Through Vapi:** we can directly create phone numbers through Vapi.

   - Vapi will provision the phone number for us
   - This can be done in the dashboard, or via the API (we will use the dashboard)

2. **Import from Twilio or Vonage:** if we already have a phone number with an external telephony provider (like Twilio or Vonage), we can import them into our Vapi account.~

# Import a Phone Number from Twilio

You can import an existing phone number you already own with **Twilio** into your Vapi account. Here's how to do it:

## Step 1: Buy a Phone Number via Twilio (if you don't have one)

If you don't already have a number in Twilio, you can purchase one by going to your Twilio console's "Buy a number" section:

</Frame>

Once you've purchased a number, it will immediately be ready for import into Vapi.

## Step 2: Locate Twilio Account SID & Auth Token

To complete the import on Vapi's side, you will need your Twilio **Account SID** and **Auth Token**.

You should see a section for "API keys & tokens" in your Twilio console. The credentials you need for the import are located here.

Once you are in the "API keys & tokens" section, grab your Account SID & Auth Token:

There are **2 ways** we can get a phone number into our Vapi account:

1. **Create a Number Through Vapi:** we can directly create phone numbers through Vapi.

   - Vapi will provision the phone number for us
   - This can be done in the dashboard, or via the API (we will use the dashboard)

2. **Import from Twilio or Vonage:** if we already have a phone number with an external telephony provider (like Twilio or Vonage), we can import them into our Vapi account.

    The quickest way to secure a phone number for your assistant is to create a phone number directly through Vapi.

    Navigate to the "Phone Numbers" section & click the "Create Phone Number" button:

    <Frame caption="Make sure you are in the 'Phone Numbers' dashboard tab.">
      <img src="/static/images/quickstart/dashboard/create-vapi-phone-number.png" />
    </Frame>

    We will use the area code `415` for our phone number (these are area codes domestic to the US).

    <Frame caption="Choose an area code for your phone number.">
      <img src="/static/images/quickstart/dashboard/buy-vapi-phone-number-modal.png" />
    </Frame>

    <Info>
      Currently, only US phone numbers can be directly created through Vapi. Phone numbers in
      other regions must be imported, see our [phone calling](/phone-calling) guide.
    </Info>

    Click "Create", after creating a phone number you should see something like this:

    <Frame caption="Here we can attach an assistant to the number for inbound calls (or perform an outbound call, with a select assistant).">
      <img src="/static/images/quickstart/dashboard/vapi-phone-number-config.png" />
    </Frame>

    <Note>
      It takes a couple of minutes for the phone number to be fully activated. During this period, calls will not be functional.
    </Note>

    Once activated, the phone number will be ready for use (either for inbound or outbound calling).
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Import from Twilio or Vonage" icon="hashtag" iconType="regular">
    We can also import an existing phone number we already own with either Twilio or Vonage.

    For example's sake, we will proceed with [**Twilio**](https://twilio.com) (though the steps are the same for Vonage as
    well).

    <AccordionGroup>
      <Accordion title="Buy a Phone Number via Twilio (optional)" icon="hashtag" iconType="solid">
        If you don't already have a number in Twilio, you can purchase one by going to your Twilio console's "Buy a number" section:

        <Frame caption="The Twilio 'Buy a Number' page in the Twilio console.">
          <img src="../static/images/quickstart/phone/buy-phone-number-twilio.png" />
        </Frame>

        Once you've purchased a number, it will immediately be ready for import into Vapi.
      </Accordion>
      <Accordion title="Locate Twilio Account SID & Auth Token" icon="key" iconType="solid">
        To complete the import on Vapi's side, we will need to grab our Twilio **"Account SID"** & **"Auth Token"**.

        You should see a section for "API keys & tokens", the credentials we will need for the import will live here.

        <Frame caption="We will want to navigate to the credentials section of our account.">
          <img src="../static/images/quickstart/phone/twilio-api-key-nav.png" />
        </Frame>

        Once we are in our "API keys & tokens" section, we will grab the Account SID & Auth Token:

        <Frame>
          <img src="../static/images/quickstart/phone/twilio-credentials.png" />
        </Frame>

        We will use both of these credentials in the next step of importing via the Dashboard.
      </Accordion>
      <Accordion title="Import via Dashboard" icon="v" iconType="solid">
        Navigate to the “Phone Numbers” section & click the “Import” button:

        <Frame caption="Click 'Import' in the 'Phone Numbers' tab of your dashboard.">
          <img src="../static/images/quickstart/phone/dashboard-import-phone-number.png" />
        </Frame>

        There you will input your phone number, as well as the credentials you retrieved in the previous step:

        <Frame >
          <img src="../static/images/quickstart/phone/import-twilio-number-dashboard.png" />
        </Frame>

        Hit "Import" & you will come to the phone number detail page:

        <Frame caption="The phone number detail page, we can configure our phone number here.">
          <img src="../static/images/quickstart/phone/phone-number-import-complete.png" />
        </Frame>

        Your number is now ready to be attached to an assistant for inbound or outbound phone calling.
